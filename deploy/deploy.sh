# Production deploy script for the PrivaTools VM.
#
# Pre-conditions (operator responsibility):
#   - You are on the Oracle VM (140.245.15.140), in /opt/privatool, as a user
#     in the `privatool` group with sudo for systemctl/nginx.
#   - node_modules already exists under frontend/. If package.json changed,
#     run `npm ci` MANUALLY before invoking this script — we deliberately
#     skip dep install on the hot path to keep deploys fast.
#   - The Python venv at /opt/privatool/.venv already has requirements.txt
#     installed. If requirements.txt changed, run
#     `/opt/privatool/.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt` first.
#
# This script is intentionally minimal-blast-radius: pull, build, restart,
# verify. No DB migrations, no schema changes, no destructive ops.
