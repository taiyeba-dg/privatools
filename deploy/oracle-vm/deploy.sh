# PrivaTools — Oracle VM auto-deploy script.
#
# Replaces ~/deploy.sh on the VM. Adds three reliability guarantees over the
# 5-line original:
#
#   1. `set -euo pipefail` — fail fast if git pull fails, docker build fails,
#      or systemctl restart fails. The original would swallow these silently.
#   2. Healthz poll after restart — confirms the new container is actually
#      serving traffic before declaring success. The original would log
#      "Deploy complete" even if the new container OOM'd and never came up.
#   3. Failure log entry — if anything goes wrong, deploy.log gets a FAILED
#      entry instead of nothing, so the operator can spot bad deploys from
#      `tail ~/deploy.log` without spelunking journalctl.
#
# Apply with:
#   scp deploy/oracle-vm/deploy.sh ubuntu@140.245.15.140:/home/ubuntu/deploy.sh.new
#   ssh ubuntu@140.245.15.140 'cp ~/deploy.sh ~/deploy.sh.bak && \
#       mv ~/deploy.sh.new ~/deploy.sh && chmod +x ~/deploy.sh'
