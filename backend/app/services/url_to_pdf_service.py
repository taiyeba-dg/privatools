"""Convert a public URL to PDF using WeasyPrint.

WeasyPrint will happily follow file://, http:// to private IPs, and
gopher://-style URLs out of the box, which makes it a textbook SSRF
foot-gun on a multi-tenant server. We validate the URL here (same
ruleset as html_to_pdf_service._validate_url) before WeasyPrint sees
it, then hand WeasyPrint the original URL.

This module previously delegated SSRF validation to the html_to_pdf
service. That worked, but meant a regression here would silently
remove protection. Validation now lives in both places.
