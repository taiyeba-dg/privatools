"""Split a PDF into chunks bounded by file size.

Original implementation re-serialized the *entire* accumulated chunk on every
page just to measure size — O(n²) memory and time on a 500-page PDF that hit
the boundary near the end. This rewrite serializes incrementally by writing
each candidate chunk to a temp file and only re-checking total size every
SAMPLE_EVERY pages, then trims back if we overshot.
