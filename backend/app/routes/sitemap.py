"""
Sitemap endpoint — generates sitemap.xml dynamically for all tool pages.

The sitemap body is a deterministic function of `date.today()` and the
in-process slug catalogues — there is no per-request data, so it is
safe to memoize the rendered XML for an entire day. We key the cache on
the date so the lastmod field stays fresh; once the wall-clock rolls
over to a new UTC day we render once and serve the bytes to every
subsequent request until the next rollover.
