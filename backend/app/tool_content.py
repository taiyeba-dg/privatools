# FAQ  –  tool slug → list of {q, a}
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOOL_FAQ: dict[str, list[dict[str, str]]] = {
    "merge-pdf": [
        {"q": "Is there a limit on how many PDFs I can merge at once?", "a": "There is no hard limit on the number of files. Each individual file must be under 500 MB. The server handles merges of dozens of files without issues."},
        {"q": "Are bookmarks and hyperlinks preserved when merging?", "a": "Yes. PrivaTools preserves existing bookmarks, internal links, and external hyperlinks from all input files in the merged result."},
        {"q": "Do I need to create an account to merge PDFs?", "a": "No. PrivaTools requires no account, no email, and no sign-up. Upload your files, merge them, and download the result."},
    ],
    "split-pdf": [
        {"q": "Can I split a PDF into individual pages?", "a": "Yes. Choose the 'Extract every page' option to get each page as a separate PDF file, all packaged in a ZIP download."},
        {"q": "Can I extract non-consecutive pages like 1, 5, and 12?", "a": "Yes. Use the 'Custom ranges' mode and enter the exact page numbers or ranges you need (e.g. 1, 5, 12 or 1-3, 12-15)."},
        {"q": "What happens to bookmarks when I split a PDF?", "a": "Bookmarks that fall within the extracted page range are preserved. Bookmarks pointing to pages outside the range are removed."},
    ],
    "split-by-size": [
        {"q": "How does size-based splitting work?", "a": "The tool splits at page boundaries to keep each chunk under your target size. It cannot split in the middle of a page, so some chunks may be slightly under the target."},
        {"q": "What is the minimum chunk size I can set?", "a": "The minimum is effectively the size of the largest single page. If one page is 5 MB, you cannot create chunks smaller than 5 MB."},
        {"q": "Is this useful for email attachment limits?", "a": "Yes. Set the chunk size to your email provider's attachment limit (e.g. 25 MB for Gmail) and each part will be small enough to attach."},
    ],
    "compress-pdf": [
        {"q": "How much can a PDF be compressed?", "a": "Results vary by content. Scanned PDFs with large images often shrink 50-80%. Text-heavy PDFs with no images may only shrink 5-15%."},
        {"q": "Does compression reduce the quality of text?", "a": "No. Text and vector graphics remain lossless. Only embedded raster images are recompressed, and only at Medium or High compression levels."},
        {"q": "Can I compress a password-protected PDF?", "a": "You need to unlock the PDF first using the Unlock PDF tool, then compress the unlocked version."},
    ],
    "edit-pdf": [
        {"q": "Can I edit the existing text in a PDF?", "a": "The editor supports adding new text, shapes, highlights, and freehand drawings. Direct editing of existing text in a PDF requires re-authoring the document."},
        {"q": "Are my annotations permanent?", "a": "Yes. When you save, annotations are flattened into the PDF so they appear identically in every viewer and cannot be removed."},
        {"q": "What annotation types are available?", "a": "Text boxes, freehand pen, highlighter, rectangles, circles, lines, and arrows. You can set color, opacity, and font size for each."},
    ],
    "sign-pdf": [
        {"q": "Is this a legally binding electronic signature?", "a": "PrivaTools creates a visual signature embedded in the PDF. Whether it is legally binding depends on your jurisdiction. For most informal agreements and internal documents, it is widely accepted."},
        {"q": "Can I sign multiple pages?", "a": "Yes. After creating your signature, you can place it on any page by navigating through the document preview."},
        {"q": "Is my signature stored on the server?", "a": "No. Your signature exists only in your browser session. The server never stores signatures — it only applies them to the PDF during processing, then deletes the file within minutes."},
    ],
    "protect-pdf": [
        {"q": "What encryption does PrivaTools use?", "a": "PDFs are encrypted with AES-256, the same standard used by banks and governments. This is the strongest encryption available for PDF files."},
        {"q": "Can I allow printing but block copying text?", "a": "Yes. You can set granular permissions: allow or deny printing, text copying, form filling, and editing independently."},
        {"q": "What happens if I forget the password?", "a": "PrivaTools does not store your password. If you lose it, there is no way to recover it. Save your password in a password manager."},
    ],
    "unlock-pdf": [
        {"q": "Can I unlock a PDF without the password?", "a": "No. PrivaTools requires you to enter the correct password. It does not crack or brute-force passwords."},
        {"q": "Does unlocking remove all restrictions?", "a": "Yes. Both the open password and permission restrictions (no-print, no-copy) are removed from the output file."},
        {"q": "Is the password transmitted securely?", "a": "Yes. The password is sent over HTTPS and is used only in memory for decryption. It is never stored or logged on the server."},
    ],
    "rotate-pdf": [
        {"q": "Can I rotate individual pages instead of the entire PDF?", "a": "Yes. Click individual page thumbnails to select specific pages, then apply the rotation angle only to those pages."},
        {"q": "Does rotation affect text searchability?", "a": "No. The text layer is preserved. The rotation only changes the visual display orientation of the page."},
        {"q": "What rotation angles are supported?", "a": "90° clockwise, 180°, and 270° clockwise (equivalent to 90° counter-clockwise)."},
    ],
    "watermark": [
        {"q": "Can I use an image as a watermark?", "a": "Yes. Upload a PNG or JPG image (logos work well). Set the opacity so the watermark is visible but does not obscure the document content."},
        {"q": "Is the watermark applied to every page?", "a": "Yes. The watermark is applied to all pages. If you need it on specific pages only, split the PDF first, watermark those pages, then merge."},
        {"q": "Can someone remove the watermark?", "a": "The watermark is flattened into the page content. It cannot be removed with a simple toggle, though advanced PDF editing tools could paint over it."},
    ],
    "ocr-pdf": [
        {"q": "What languages does OCR support?", "a": "PrivaTools uses Tesseract, which supports over 100 languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Hindi."},
        {"q": "Will OCR change how my PDF looks?", "a": "No. OCR adds an invisible text layer behind the scanned image. The visual appearance is identical — but you can now search and copy text."},
        {"q": "How accurate is the OCR?", "a": "Accuracy depends on scan quality. Clean 300 DPI scans typically achieve 95-99% accuracy. Low-resolution or skewed scans may need manual correction."},
    ],
    "redact-pdf": [
        {"q": "Is redaction permanent?", "a": "Yes. Redacted content is permanently destroyed at the pixel and text level. It cannot be recovered by removing the black boxes or by any forensic tool."},
        {"q": "Can I search and redact all instances of a word?", "a": "Yes. Use the search function to find all occurrences of a name, number, or phrase and mark them all for redaction at once."},
        {"q": "What is the difference between redaction and covering with a black box?", "a": "A black box drawn as an annotation can be removed to reveal the text underneath. Redaction permanently deletes the underlying text and image data."},
    ],
    "flatten-pdf": [
        {"q": "What does flattening a PDF mean?", "a": "Flattening converts interactive elements like form fields, annotations, and layers into static page content. The visual appearance stays the same but the elements can no longer be edited."},
        {"q": "When should I flatten a PDF?", "a": "Flatten before sharing filled forms (to prevent edits), before printing (to avoid rendering issues), or when a recipient's PDF viewer does not display annotations correctly."},
        {"q": "Does flattening reduce file size?", "a": "Sometimes. Removing form field metadata and annotation data can slightly reduce file size, but the effect depends on the document."},
    ],
    "bookmarks": [
        {"q": "Can I create a multi-level bookmark tree?", "a": "Yes. You can nest bookmarks under parent entries to create a hierarchical table of contents with multiple levels."},
        {"q": "Do bookmarks work in all PDF readers?", "a": "Yes. The bookmarks use the standard PDF outline format supported by Adobe Reader, Preview, Chrome, Firefox, and all major PDF viewers."},
        {"q": "Can I import a bookmark structure from a text file?", "a": "Currently, bookmarks are created manually in the editor. You can copy-paste titles and set page numbers individually."},
    ],
    "form-creator": [
        {"q": "What field types can I add?", "a": "Text inputs, text areas, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, date pickers, and signature fields."},
        {"q": "Will the form work in Adobe Reader?", "a": "Yes. The forms use the standard AcroForm format, which is compatible with Adobe Reader, Foxit, and all major PDF viewers."},
        {"q": "Can I set fields as required?", "a": "Yes. Mark any field as required to prevent submission without filling it in. You can also set validation rules like numeric-only or email format."},
    ],
    "extract-tables": [
        {"q": "What output formats are supported?", "a": "CSV, Excel (.xlsx), and JSON. Each table is extracted separately and all results are packaged in a ZIP file."},
        {"q": "Can it extract tables from scanned PDFs?", "a": "For best results, run OCR first using the OCR tool to create a text layer, then use table extraction. The tool works best with text-based PDFs."},
        {"q": "How does the tool detect table boundaries?", "a": "It uses Camelot and Tabula libraries, which detect ruled lines and text alignment patterns to identify table structures. Tables without visible borders may need manual page selection."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-pdfa": [
        {"q": "What is PDF/A and why would I need it?", "a": "PDF/A is an ISO-standardized archival format that ensures documents remain viewable long-term. Government agencies, courts, and archives often require PDF/A submissions."},
        {"q": "What changes does the conversion make?", "a": "The tool embeds all fonts, converts color spaces to sRGB, removes JavaScript and multimedia, and adds the required PDF/A metadata."},
        {"q": "Will the document look different after conversion?", "a": "Visually the document should look the same. Transparency may be flattened in PDF/A-1b, and embedded multimedia will be removed since PDF/A does not allow it."},
    ],
    "image-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "What image formats are supported?", "a": "JPG, PNG, WebP, BMP, and TIFF. Each image can be up to 500 MB."},
        {"q": "Can I control the page size?", "a": "Yes. Choose A4, Letter, or fit-to-image (where the page matches the image dimensions exactly). You can also set landscape or portrait orientation."},
        {"q": "Are multiple images combined into one PDF?", "a": "Yes. All uploaded images become pages in a single PDF. Drag to reorder them before converting."},
    ],
    "txt-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Can I change the font and page size?", "a": "Yes. Choose from several font families (serif, sans-serif, monospace), set the font size, and select A4 or Letter page size with custom margins."},
        {"q": "Does the tool handle Unicode text?", "a": "Yes. UTF-8 encoded text is fully supported, including non-Latin scripts like Chinese, Arabic, Cyrillic, and Devanagari."},
        {"q": "Is there a character or line limit?", "a": "No character limit beyond the 500 MB file-size cap. The text is automatically reflowed and paginated."},
    ],
    "office-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Which Office formats are supported?", "a": "Word (.doc, .docx), Excel (.xls, .xlsx), PowerPoint (.ppt, .pptx), and OpenDocument formats (.odt, .ods, .odp)."},
        {"q": "Are charts and images preserved?", "a": "Yes. The conversion uses LibreOffice, which preserves charts, images, tables, headers, footers, and most formatting accurately."},
        {"q": "How long does conversion take?", "a": "Most documents convert in 2-10 seconds. Large files with many images or complex layouts may take up to 30 seconds."},
    ],
    "word-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Is formatting preserved during conversion?", "a": "Yes. LibreOffice preserves fonts, styles, tables, images, headers, footers, and table-of-contents links. Minor differences may occur with uncommon fonts."},
        {"q": "Are .doc (legacy) files supported?", "a": "Yes. Both the older .doc format and the modern .docx format are supported."},
        {"q": "What about tracked changes and comments?", "a": "Tracked changes and comments visible in the document will appear in the PDF. Accept or reject changes in Word first if you want a clean output."},
    ],
    "epub-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Are images and formatting preserved?", "a": "Yes. Chapter headings, bold/italic text, embedded images, and basic CSS styling are preserved in the PDF output."},
        {"q": "Can I convert DRM-protected EPUBs?", "a": "No. DRM-protected e-books cannot be converted. The tool only works with DRM-free EPUB files."},
        {"q": "What page size options are available?", "a": "A4, Letter, and custom dimensions. The text is reflowed to fit the chosen page size while keeping chapter breaks."},
    ],
    "html-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Can I convert a live website URL to PDF?", "a": "Yes. Enter any public URL and the server will render the page — including CSS, images, and JavaScript — and convert it to PDF."},
        {"q": "Is JavaScript rendered?", "a": "Yes. A headless browser executes JavaScript before capturing the page, so dynamically loaded content appears in the PDF."},
        {"q": "Are external stylesheets and images included?", "a": "Yes. The renderer fetches external CSS, web fonts, and images. Only resources behind authentication may not load."},
    ],
    "xml-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "What XML schemas are supported?", "a": "Any well-formed XML file is supported. The tool renders the structure as a readable tree or table — it does not apply XSL transforms."},
        {"q": "Is syntax highlighting included?", "a": "Yes. Element names, attributes, and values are color-coded for readability in the PDF output."},
        {"q": "Can I convert large XML files?", "a": "Files up to 500 MB are supported. Very deeply nested structures may produce many pages."},
    ],
    "csv-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Does the tool auto-detect delimiters?", "a": "Yes. Comma, semicolon, tab, and pipe delimiters are automatically detected. You can also specify the delimiter manually."},
        {"q": "How are wide tables handled?", "a": "Wide tables can be rendered in landscape orientation. If they still exceed the page width, columns are scaled to fit or split across pages."},
        {"q": "Is the first row treated as a header?", "a": "By default yes — the first row is bolded as a header. You can disable this if your data has no header row."},
    ],
    "json-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Is JSON validated before conversion?", "a": "Yes. The tool validates the JSON and shows a clear error message with the line number if the syntax is invalid."},
        {"q": "How are nested objects displayed?", "a": "Nested objects and arrays are indented with syntax highlighting. Collapsible sections are shown in the preview but expanded in the PDF."},
        {"q": "Can I convert JSON arrays into tables?", "a": "Yes. Arrays of objects with consistent keys are rendered as a table, with keys as column headers and each object as a row."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-word": [
        {"q": "How accurate is the PDF to Word conversion?", "a": "Text, images, and simple tables convert well. Complex multi-column layouts or heavily designed PDFs may need manual adjustments in Word."},
        {"q": "Can I convert scanned PDFs to Word?", "a": "Yes. Scanned PDFs go through OCR first to extract text, then the text is placed into a .docx file. Run OCR separately first for best results."},
        {"q": "What Word format is produced?", "a": "The output is a .docx file compatible with Microsoft Word 2007 and later, Google Docs, and LibreOffice Writer."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-excel": [
        {"q": "Does it convert the entire PDF or just tables?", "a": "The tool focuses on extracting tabular data. Each detected table becomes a separate sheet in the Excel file. Non-table text is not included."},
        {"q": "Can I choose which tables to extract?", "a": "Yes. Select specific pages, or let the tool auto-detect all tables in the document."},
        {"q": "What if my PDF has no visible table borders?", "a": "The tool can detect tables based on text alignment even without borders, but results are more reliable with clearly ruled tables."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-text": [
        {"q": "Is formatting preserved in the text output?", "a": "The tool extracts raw text only. Bold, italic, font sizes, and layout are not preserved — you get clean plain text."},
        {"q": "Can I extract text from a specific page range?", "a": "Yes. Specify page numbers or ranges to extract text from only the pages you need."},
        {"q": "How does it handle multi-column layouts?", "a": "The tool reads text in natural reading order. Two-column layouts are generally handled correctly, but complex magazine-style layouts may interleave columns."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-image": [
        {"q": "What DPI should I use?", "a": "150 DPI is good for on-screen viewing. Use 300 DPI for printing. Higher values like 600 DPI produce large files but maximum detail."},
        {"q": "Which image formats are available?", "a": "PNG (lossless, best for text-heavy pages), JPG (smaller files, good for photos), and WebP (modern format with excellent compression)."},
        {"q": "Can I convert just specific pages?", "a": "Yes. Enter individual page numbers or ranges (e.g. 1-3, 7) to convert only the pages you need."},
    ],
    "heic-to-jpg": [
        {"q": "Why can't I open HEIC files on my computer?", "a": "HEIC is Apple's default photo format since iOS 11. Windows and many web apps do not support it natively. Converting to JPG makes the images universally compatible."},
        {"q": "Is image quality lost during conversion?", "a": "At quality 90-100, the difference is imperceptible. Lower quality settings reduce file size with minimal visible degradation."},
        {"q": "Is EXIF data preserved?", "a": "Yes. Camera data, GPS location, and orientation are preserved by default. Use the Remove EXIF tool afterward if you want to strip metadata."},
    ],
    "remove-exif": [
        {"q": "What metadata is removed?", "a": "All EXIF, IPTC, and XMP metadata — including GPS coordinates, camera model, date/time, software used, and thumbnail previews."},
        {"q": "Does removing EXIF data change image quality?", "a": "No. Only the metadata bytes are removed. The actual image pixels are not re-encoded or modified in any way."},
        {"q": "Why should I remove EXIF data?", "a": "EXIF data can contain your GPS location, device identifiers, and timestamps. Removing it before sharing photos online protects your privacy."},
    ],
    "image-compressor": [
        {"q": "Is PNG compression lossless?", "a": "Yes. PNG compression in PrivaTools is lossless — the image quality is identical to the original, only the file size is reduced through better encoding."},
        {"q": "What compression ratio can I expect?", "a": "JPG images typically shrink 40-70% at quality 75. PNG images shrink 10-40% depending on content. Screenshots compress better than photographs."},
        {"q": "Can I batch-compress multiple images?", "a": "Yes. Upload multiple images at once and they are all compressed with the same settings. Download them together in a ZIP file."},
    ],
    "remove-background": [
        {"q": "What subjects work best?", "a": "People, animals, products, and objects with clear edges work best. The AI model handles hair, fur, and semi-transparent edges well."},
        {"q": "What is the output format?", "a": "The output is a PNG with a transparent background. You can also choose to replace the background with a solid color."},
        {"q": "Does it work on group photos?", "a": "Yes, but results vary. The model detects the primary foreground subject. Complex scenes with multiple overlapping people may need manual touch-up."},
    ],
    "video-to-gif": [
        {"q": "What is the maximum GIF duration?", "a": "There is no strict limit, but GIFs longer than 15-30 seconds can become very large. Keeping clips short produces better results."},
        {"q": "Can I control the file size?", "a": "Yes. Lower the frame rate (10 fps is usually enough), reduce the width, and shorten the duration to get smaller files."},
        {"q": "Which video formats are supported?", "a": "MP4, WebM, MOV, and AVI. The server uses FFmpeg, which supports virtually all common video codecs."},
    ],
    "compress-video": [
        {"q": "How much can a video be compressed?", "a": "Typical results are 30-70% size reduction at Medium compression. Raw or high-bitrate videos see the largest savings."},
        {"q": "Does compression change the video resolution?", "a": "No. The resolution stays the same by default. Only the bitrate is reduced. You can optionally lower the resolution for even smaller files."},
        {"q": "What output format is used?", "a": "The output is MP4 with H.264 encoding, which is universally compatible with all devices and browsers."},
    ],
    "trim-media": [
        {"q": "Can I trim audio files too?", "a": "Yes. The tool supports both audio (MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC) and video (MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI) files."},
        {"q": "Is the trimmed file re-encoded?", "a": "When possible, the tool uses lossless cutting (no re-encoding) to preserve original quality. Some format combinations require re-encoding."},
        {"q": "How precise is the trimming?", "a": "Precision depends on the format. MP4 can be cut to the nearest keyframe (typically within 0.5 seconds). Re-encoded output is frame-accurate."},
    ],
    "base64": [
        {"q": "Can I encode files (not just text)?", "a": "Yes. Upload any file — images, PDFs, binaries — and the tool returns the Base64-encoded string. Useful for embedding files in JSON, HTML, or CSS."},
        {"q": "Is there a size limit for encoding?", "a": "Files up to 500 MB can be encoded. Keep in mind that Base64 output is approximately 33% larger than the original file."},
        {"q": "What character set is used?", "a": "Standard Base64 (RFC 4648) using A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, and /. URL-safe Base64 (replacing + and / with - and _) is also available."},
    ],
    "text-diff": [
        {"q": "What diff algorithm is used?", "a": "The tool uses a line-by-line diff algorithm similar to Unix diff, highlighting additions, deletions, and modifications with color coding."},
        {"q": "Can I compare files directly?", "a": "Yes. Upload two text files instead of pasting. Supported formats include .txt, .csv, .json, .xml, .html, .css, .js, .py, and other plain-text formats."},
        {"q": "Is there a file size limit for comparison?", "a": "Each file can be up to 500 MB. Very large files may take a few seconds to process the diff."},
        {"q": "Can I compare code files?", "a": "Yes. The diff viewer works with any plain-text format. It highlights changes line by line, making it useful for comparing code, configs, or data files."},
    ],
    "batch-compress-pdf": [
        {"q": "How many PDFs can I compress at once?", "a": "You can upload up to 50 PDF files per batch. Each file can be up to 500 MB. All files are compressed in parallel using 4-core processing."},
        {"q": "What compression levels are available?", "a": "Three levels: Light (minimal quality loss, ~20% reduction), Balanced (good quality with ~50% reduction), and Extreme (maximum compression, up to 90% smaller)."},
        {"q": "How do I get my compressed files?", "a": "All compressed PDFs are packaged into a single ZIP file for download. Each file keeps its original name with '_compressed' appended."},
    ],
    "pdf-page-counter": [
        {"q": "How many PDFs can I count at once?", "a": "Upload up to 100 PDF files. The tool instantly reports the page count for each file plus the total across all files."},
        {"q": "Does it work with encrypted PDFs?", "a": "Yes, the page counter works with most encrypted PDFs since it only reads metadata, not content. Password-protected PDFs that block all access may show as invalid."},
        {"q": "Is this useful for print quotes?", "a": "Absolutely. Print shops and copy centers use this to quickly count total pages across multiple documents for accurate pricing."},
    ],
    "image-upscaler": [
        {"q": "What upscaling methods are available?", "a": "The tool uses Lanczos resampling, a high-quality interpolation algorithm that produces sharp, artifact-free results. Choose 2x or 4x enlargement."},
        {"q": "What image formats are supported?", "a": "JPG, PNG, and WebP images are supported. The output format matches the input — upload a JPG, get a JPG back."},
        {"q": "Is there a maximum image size?", "a": "The upscaled result cannot exceed 100 megapixels. For a 4x upscale, this means input images up to about 2500x2500 pixels."},
    ],
    "audio-converter": [
        {"q": "What audio formats are supported?", "a": "Convert between MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, and AAC. The tool uses FFmpeg for professional-quality conversion with precise codec handling."},
        {"q": "Can I choose the bitrate?", "a": "Yes. Available bitrates: 64k (small file), 128k (good), 192k (high quality), 256k (very high), and 320k (maximum). Default is 192k."},
        {"q": "What is the file size limit?", "a": "Audio files up to 200 MB are supported. This covers most audio files including full albums in lossless FLAC format."},
    ],

    # ── v1.1.0 + v1.2.0 additions ─────────────────────────────────────────
    "highlight-pdf": [
        {"q": "Are the highlights real PDF annotations or flattened images?", "a": "Real PDF annotations. They render in every PDF viewer and can be removed later if you reopen the file in an editor. Nothing about the underlying text is changed."},
        {"q": "Can I highlight multiple phrases at once?", "a": "Run the tool once per phrase. Each run preserves previous highlights, so you can layer different colors for different keywords."},
        {"q": "Does the highlighter respect case?", "a": "Toggle case-sensitive matching for exact-case search; leave it off for case-insensitive flexible matching. Case-insensitive is the default."},
    ],
    "summarize-pdf": [
        {"q": "Is my PDF really not uploaded?", "a": "Correct. The summarization model loads once into your browser (~250 MB, cached in IndexedDB). After load, summarization runs entirely in WebAssembly inside your tab. Verify by opening DevTools → Network — no requests fire while summarization is running."},
        {"q": "How long does it take?", "a": "About 2–4 seconds per chunk on a modern laptop. A 100-page PDF takes 3–6 minutes; a 10-page PDF takes 30–60 seconds."},
        {"q": "What languages are supported?", "a": "The default distilbart-cnn model is English-only. For other languages we plan to add multilingual mT5 in a future release."},
        {"q": "Is the summary as good as ChatGPT?", "a": "Not quite — frontier cloud models are 50–100x larger. distilbart produces good professional summaries but won't match GPT-4 quality. The trade-off is full privacy."},
    ],
    "smart-redact": [
        {"q": "What entities does it detect?", "a": "Names (persons and organizations), emails, phone numbers, postal addresses, SSNs, credit card numbers, dates, and locations. The BERT model also catches custom patterns via regex hooks."},
        {"q": "Where does the NER scan run?", "a": "Entirely in your browser using @huggingface/transformers WebAssembly. The PDF text never leaves your machine during detection."},
        {"q": "Is the redaction reversible?", "a": "No. The backend applies real PyMuPDF redactions which permanently remove the underlying content. The redacted file cannot be 'unredacted' without the original."},
        {"q": "How is this different from regular Redact?", "a": "Regular Redact requires you to draw rectangles manually. Smart Redact auto-detects sensitive entities so you only need to review and confirm."},
    ],
    "split-in-half": [
        {"q": "When would I use this?", "a": "For two-up scans (where two pages were scanned side-by-side onto one physical page), scanned booklets, or any PDF where each page should be two pages in the output."},
        {"q": "Does it work on PDFs with mixed page sizes?", "a": "Yes. Each page is split independently at its own midpoint, so different page sizes work fine."},
        {"q": "What's the difference between vertical and horizontal?", "a": "Vertical bisects each page down the middle into left and right halves (the common case for landscape two-up scans). Horizontal bisects across the middle into top and bottom halves."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-svg": [
        {"q": "What kind of PDFs convert best?", "a": "Vector PDFs (drawn in Illustrator, Inkscape, Figma, LaTeX, etc.) convert into editable vector SVGs. Scanned/raster PDFs become SVGs containing embedded images."},
        {"q": "How many SVG files come back?", "a": "One per page, packaged into a ZIP."},
        {"q": "Can I edit the SVGs after?", "a": "Yes. Open in any vector editor (Illustrator, Inkscape, Figma). Text and paths are editable."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-html": [
        {"q": "How accurate is the conversion?", "a": "PyMuPDF preserves text positioning and fonts via inline styles. Layout is faithful for simple documents; complex multi-column or floating-element layouts may need manual cleanup."},
        {"q": "Are images included?", "a": "Yes. Embedded images come through as base64-encoded inline data URLs, so the HTML is fully self-contained — no external image files needed."},
        {"q": "Why convert PDF to HTML?", "a": "Web archiving, accessibility (screen readers handle HTML better than complex PDFs), republishing offline documents online, or any use where you need the content as a web page."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-rtf": [
        {"q": "What's RTF good for?", "a": "Rich Text Format opens in every word processor (Word, Pages, LibreOffice, WordPad) without the bloat of .docx and with better text fidelity than .txt. Useful for legacy or cross-platform document exchange."},
        {"q": "Are images preserved?", "a": "No. The current implementation focuses on text and structure. For full visual fidelity, use PDF to Word instead."},
        {"q": "Does it handle Unicode?", "a": "Yes. Non-ASCII characters are encoded via the standard RTF \\uN escape mechanism."},
    ],
    "web-optimize-pdf": [
        {"q": "What does linearization actually do?", "a": "It reorganizes the PDF byte layout so the first page's objects come first in the file. A byte-range-aware viewer can then start rendering the first page while the rest still downloads."},
        {"q": "Does it change file size?", "a": "Usually slightly smaller, sometimes slightly larger — the rearrangement adds a small overhead but qpdf also re-streams and recompresses where it can."},
        {"q": "Do I need this for a PDF served from my own server?", "a": "Only if you're serving large PDFs and want the inline-viewer experience to feel fast. For small (<2 MB) PDFs the difference is invisible."},
    ],
    "split-by-text": [
        {"q": "How does it decide where to split?", "a": "It scans every page for your search term. Every page that contains the term becomes the start of a new chunk. The chunk runs until the next match-page or the end of the document."},
        {"q": "Can I use a regex?", "a": "Not in the current version — the search is a literal string match (case-sensitive optional). For regex splits, use the dev API directly."},
        {"q": "What if my keyword doesn't appear at all?", "a": "The tool returns a 400 error with a clear message. Make sure your search exactly matches the casing if you have case-sensitive enabled."},
    ],
    "view-exif": [
        {"q": "What metadata does it show?", "a": "All standard EXIF tags (camera make/model, lens, ISO, exposure, focal length, timestamps), GPS sub-IFD (latitude, longitude, altitude), IPTC, and XMP-embedded fields, plus PNG tEXt chunks if present."},
        {"q": "Does this strip the metadata?", "a": "No — this is read-only. To strip metadata, use Remove EXIF."},
        {"q": "Why does my photo have GPS coordinates?", "a": "Most smartphones embed GPS coordinates in photos by default. They reveal exactly where the photo was taken. Strip them before posting publicly."},
    ],
    "jwt-decoder": [
        {"q": "Is it safe to paste a real production JWT here?", "a": "Yes — decoding happens entirely in your browser using JavaScript's atob(). No part of the token is sent to a server. Verify by checking DevTools → Network."},
        {"q": "Can it verify the signature?", "a": "Not in this tool. Verification requires the issuer's signing key (HMAC secret for HS*, public key for RS*/ES*). The decoder displays the signature for inspection but doesn't validate it."},
        {"q": "What if my JWT is malformed?", "a": "If the three-part dot structure is wrong, you'll see a clear error. If the base64 is malformed, the parser shows which segment failed."},
    ],
    "regex-tester": [
        {"q": "Which regex flavor does it use?", "a": "JavaScript RegExp (ECMAScript). The same engine that powers browser pattern matching. Most patterns are portable to Python re, PCRE, or Go regexp with minor adjustments."},
        {"q": "Is my test text saved anywhere?", "a": "No. Pattern and text are kept in browser state only. Refresh the page and they're gone. No server-side storage."},
        {"q": "How many matches can it handle?", "a": "Tested up to ~10,000 matches without slowdown. Beyond that, the highlighting may lag but the match list still renders."},
    ],
    "timestamp-converter": [
        {"q": "How does it know if a number is seconds or milliseconds?", "a": "By magnitude. Numbers larger than 10^12 (Sep 2001 onward in milliseconds) are treated as milliseconds; smaller as seconds. You can also paste an ISO 8601 string explicitly."},
        {"q": "Why is the local time different from the UTC time?", "a": "Your browser's timezone offset is applied. The UTC value is what's actually stored in the timestamp; local is just for human convenience."},
        {"q": "Can I generate a future timestamp?", "a": "Yes. Type or paste any past or future ISO date and you'll get the corresponding epoch. The relative phrase will say 'in X days' for the future."},
    ],
    "batch-compress-pdf": [
        {"q": "How many PDFs can I upload?", "a": "Up to 50 files per batch, up to 500 MB per file."},
        {"q": "Are they compressed in parallel?", "a": "Yes — the backend runs 4 worker processes simultaneously, so 4 files compress at once. Total time scales nearly linearly with file count divided by 4."},
        {"q": "What's the difference between Light, Recommended, and Extreme?", "a": "Light shrinks structure only (5–30% reduction, no visible quality loss). Recommended (default) resamples images at 150 DPI (40–70% reduction). Extreme drops to 96 DPI and lower JPEG quality (60–90% reduction)."},
    ],
    "pdf-page-counter": [
        {"q": "How is this faster than opening each PDF?", "a": "The tool reads only the PDF's page metadata, not the page content. For 100 PDFs the total scan time is typically under a second."},
        {"q": "Does it work on encrypted PDFs?", "a": "Yes for most. Password-protected PDFs that block metadata access return as invalid."},
        {"q": "Useful for print pricing?", "a": "Yes — print shops use this exact tool to count total pages across multi-file print jobs for instant quotes."},
    ],
    "webp-to-jpg": [
        {"q": "Why convert WebP to JPG?", "a": "WebP isn't supported by all software, email clients, or older browsers. JPG is universal — every image viewer can open it."},
        {"q": "Will the quality be the same?", "a": "Essentially yes. Default JPG quality is 85, which is visually indistinguishable from the WebP source at typical viewing sizes."},
        {"q": "Does it preserve transparency?", "a": "No — JPEG doesn't support transparency. Transparent pixels in the source render as white in the JPG. Use HEIC to PNG or WebP to PNG if you need transparency preserved."},
    ],
    "webp-to-png": [
        {"q": "Why convert WebP to PNG?", "a": "PNG is lossless and supports transparency, making it ideal for graphics, logos, screenshots, and anywhere you need pixel-perfect output."},
        {"q": "How much larger is the PNG?", "a": "Typically 3–5x the size of the WebP source. PNG compression is lossless but less efficient than WebP."},
        {"q": "Does it preserve transparency?", "a": "Yes. Transparent pixels in the WebP come through unchanged in the PNG."},
    ],
    "heic-to-png": [
        {"q": "What's HEIC and why convert it?", "a": "HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is Apple's image format from iOS 11 onward. It's space-efficient but not widely supported outside Apple's ecosystem. PNG works everywhere."},
        {"q": "Is PNG better than JPG for HEIC conversion?", "a": "If you need transparency or are doing further editing: yes. For sharing on the web or attaching to emails: JPG is fine and 3–5x smaller."},
        {"q": "Are EXIF tags preserved?", "a": "Most are stripped during conversion (since PNG and HEIC have different metadata formats). If you need to preserve EXIF, use HEIC to JPG instead and the standard EXIF block survives."},
    ],

    # ── v1.4.0 — additional format converter aliases ─────────────────────
    "jpg-to-png": [
        {"q": "Why convert JPG to PNG?", "a": "PNG is lossless — every pixel of the source is preserved. Use PNG when you plan to do further editing (each JPG save degrades the image) or when you need transparency in compositing."},
        {"q": "Will the PNG be larger?", "a": "Yes — typically 3–10× larger, because PNG is lossless while JPG is compressed. For photos, JPG is usually a better choice unless you specifically need lossless quality."},
        {"q": "Does it preserve metadata?", "a": "Standard EXIF data is preserved when possible. Color profiles (sRGB, Adobe RGB) are written into the PNG header."},
    ],
    "png-to-jpg": [
        {"q": "Why convert PNG to JPG?", "a": "JPG files are 70–90% smaller than equivalent PNGs for photographs — perfect when you need to email, upload, or post images without bandwidth penalties."},
        {"q": "What happens to transparency?", "a": "JPG doesn't support transparency. Transparent pixels are flattened to white. If you need to preserve transparency, use PNG to WebP instead."},
        {"q": "Will I lose quality?", "a": "JPG is lossy, but at quality 85 (our default) the difference is essentially invisible. Re-saving the same JPG repeatedly does degrade — convert once, then keep the original PNG as a master."},
    ],
    "jpg-to-webp": [
        {"q": "Why convert JPG to WebP?", "a": "WebP files are typically 25–35% smaller than JPGs at the same visual quality. That speeds up page loads and saves bandwidth, especially for image-heavy sites."},
        {"q": "Will every browser display WebP?", "a": "Yes — every major browser supports WebP since 2020 (Chrome, Firefox, Safari 14+, Edge). For maximum compatibility with very old browsers or email clients, use JPG."},
        {"q": "Is WebP a lossy format?", "a": "It can be either. Our default is lossy WebP for best compression. Lossless WebP is also supported but produces larger files."},
    ],
    "png-to-webp": [
        {"q": "Why convert PNG to WebP?", "a": "Lossless WebP is typically 25% smaller than PNG; lossy WebP is dramatically smaller. Either way, you save bandwidth — useful for web assets, icons, and product images."},
        {"q": "Is transparency preserved?", "a": "Yes. WebP supports an alpha channel exactly like PNG, so transparent areas come through unchanged."},
        {"q": "When should I stay with PNG?", "a": "If you need maximum compatibility with very old software, PDF generators, or print pipelines — PNG is supported everywhere."},
    ],
    "tiff-to-jpg": [
        {"q": "Why convert TIFF to JPG?", "a": "TIFF files from scanners are often 10–50 MB each. JPG shrinks them to a few hundred KB, perfect for email and online sharing where quality at 85% is indistinguishable."},
        {"q": "What about multi-page TIFFs?", "a": "Only the first page is converted to JPG. To handle multi-page TIFFs, use our TIFF to PDF tool instead — it preserves all pages."},
        {"q": "Will I lose quality?", "a": "Some, but at our default quality of 85, the difference is essentially invisible at typical viewing sizes."},
    ],
    "tiff-to-png": [
        {"q": "Why convert TIFF to PNG?", "a": "TIFF is excellent for archival but heavyweight and not browser-friendly. PNG is universally supported and still lossless — perfect for sharing scanned documents online."},
        {"q": "Is the conversion lossless?", "a": "Yes. Both TIFF and PNG are lossless image formats, so no pixel data is lost. The PNG is typically 30–60% smaller because PNG's compression is more efficient for typical scan content."},
        {"q": "Will multi-page TIFFs be handled?", "a": "Only the first page is converted. For multi-page TIFF archives, use our TIFF to PDF tool to preserve every page."},
    ],
    "bmp-to-jpg": [
        {"q": "Why convert BMP to JPG?", "a": "BMP files are uncompressed and can be 10–50× larger than the same image as JPG. Converting saves enormous space with virtually no visible quality difference for photos."},
        {"q": "What about screenshots in BMP?", "a": "For screenshots and pixel art, consider BMP to PNG instead — PNG is lossless and handles sharp edges better than JPG."},
        {"q": "Are old Windows BMPs supported?", "a": "Yes. All standard BMP variants (1-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit, RLE-compressed) are supported."},
    ],
    "bmp-to-png": [
        {"q": "Why convert BMP to PNG?", "a": "PNG is lossless like BMP but uses compression — typically 70–90% smaller files. PNG is also the standard format for web and modern software."},
        {"q": "Will my screenshots look identical?", "a": "Yes — pixel-perfect identical. PNG uses lossless compression, so no pixel data changes."},
        {"q": "What about indexed-color BMPs?", "a": "Supported. 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit palette BMPs convert to indexed-color PNGs preserving the original palette."},
    ],
    "gif-to-jpg": [
        {"q": "What about animated GIFs?", "a": "Only the first frame is converted. To extract every frame as JPGs, use a dedicated GIF frame extractor — coming soon to PrivaTools."},
        {"q": "Will transparency be preserved?", "a": "No — JPG doesn't support transparency. Transparent pixels in the source GIF become white in the JPG."},
        {"q": "Why convert GIF to JPG anyway?", "a": "GIFs are limited to 256 colors and can be larger than JPGs of the same single frame. JPG is ideal when you only need a static still and want smaller file size."},
    ],
    "gif-to-png": [
        {"q": "What about animated GIFs?", "a": "Only the first frame is converted to PNG. For animated GIFs, consider converting to a video format like MP4 or WebM using our GIF to MP4 tool."},
        {"q": "Will transparency be preserved?", "a": "Yes — PNG fully supports transparency, so transparent areas of the GIF come through cleanly."},
        {"q": "Is the conversion lossless?", "a": "Yes. Both GIF and PNG are lossless formats, so the first frame is reproduced pixel-perfectly."},
    ],
    "m4a-to-mp3": [
        {"q": "Why convert M4A to MP3?", "a": "M4A (AAC inside an MP4 container) isn't universally supported — older car stereos, some Android players, and many legacy devices won't play it. MP3 works everywhere."},
        {"q": "Will the audio quality drop?", "a": "Slightly. M4A's AAC codec is more efficient than MP3, so at the same bitrate AAC sounds better. Our 192 kbps default produces a result that's indistinguishable from the source for casual listening."},
        {"q": "Does it work for iPhone voice memos?", "a": "Yes — voice memos export as M4A and convert cleanly to MP3 here."},
    ],
    "mp4-to-mp3": [
        {"q": "Does this work for any MP4?", "a": "Yes — as long as the MP4 has an audio track. Music videos, lecture recordings, podcasts, screen recordings with narration, all work."},
        {"q": "What about file size?", "a": "MP3 audio is dramatically smaller than the original video. A 1 GB video file typically becomes a 5–15 MB MP3."},
        {"q": "Is the video kept?", "a": "No — only the audio track is extracted. If you also need the video, keep the original MP4."},
    ],
    "mov-to-mp4": [
        {"q": "Why convert MOV to MP4?", "a": "MOV is Apple's QuickTime format. While Macs play it natively, Windows, Android, and most streaming platforms prefer MP4. The codecs inside are often identical (H.264), so conversion is fast and lossless."},
        {"q": "Will I lose quality?", "a": "Usually no — when streams are compatible, we remux the file (no re-encoding), preserving the original bytes exactly. If re-encoding is needed, we use high-quality settings."},
        {"q": "Does it preserve audio?", "a": "Yes. The audio track (typically AAC) is kept intact."},
    ],
    "avi-to-mp4": [
        {"q": "Why convert AVI to MP4?", "a": "AVI is an old Microsoft container with poor support for modern codecs and metadata. MP4 is the universal standard — every modern device, browser, and editor plays it."},
        {"q": "What if my AVI uses DivX or Xvid?", "a": "FFmpeg re-encodes the video to H.264 inside the MP4 container, so any source codec is handled."},
        {"q": "Will the file get bigger or smaller?", "a": "Usually similar or smaller. Old AVIs often used inefficient codecs; modern H.264 typically achieves the same quality at a smaller size."},
    ],
    "webm-to-mp4": [
        {"q": "Why convert WebM to MP4?", "a": "WebM (VP8/VP9 codecs) isn't supported on iOS Safari, older Android, or in many editing programs. MP4 with H.264 is universal."},
        {"q": "Does the audio survive?", "a": "Yes. WebM's Opus or Vorbis audio is re-encoded to AAC inside the MP4 container."},
        {"q": "Will I lose quality?", "a": "Re-encoding always sacrifices a tiny amount of quality, but at high bitrates the result is visually identical to the source."},
    ],
    "mp4-to-webm": [
        {"q": "Why convert MP4 to WebM?", "a": "WebM uses VP9, which is royalty-free and often produces smaller files than H.264 at the same quality. Ideal for hosting video on the open web."},
        {"q": "Will every browser play it?", "a": "Every modern desktop browser plays WebM. Safari on iOS supports it from iOS 16 onward. For maximum compatibility, MP4 is still safer."},
        {"q": "How much smaller will it be?", "a": "Typically 20–40% smaller than the equivalent MP4 at the same visible quality."},
    ],
    "yaml-to-json": [
        {"q": "Is it 100% in my browser?", "a": "Yes. The YAML never leaves your device — no server roundtrip, no logs, no analytics on the content."},
        {"q": "Which YAML features are supported?", "a": "All common config features: scalars, lists, nested maps, quoted strings, comments, multi-line strings, and flow-style arrays and objects. Anchors, tags, and multi-doc streams are not supported — those are rare in practice."},
        {"q": "What if my YAML has a parse error?", "a": "The error message appears in the output area with line context. Fix the YAML and the conversion updates instantly."},
    ],
    "json-to-yaml": [
        {"q": "Is it 100% in my browser?", "a": "Yes. The JSON never leaves your device — pure-browser conversion, no upload."},
        {"q": "Will it format the YAML correctly?", "a": "Yes — proper indentation (2 spaces), keys with special characters get quoted, lists get the bullet-point style by default. Output is ready to paste into a Kubernetes or GitHub Actions file."},
        {"q": "What if the JSON is invalid?", "a": "An error appears in the output area. Fix the JSON and the conversion updates live."},
    ],
    "case-converter": [
        {"q": "Which case formats are supported?", "a": "12: lowercase, UPPERCASE, Title Case, Sentence case, camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, kebab-case, CONSTANT_CASE, dot.case, path/case, and iNVERSE."},
        {"q": "Will it handle existing camelCase or snake_case input correctly?", "a": "Yes. The tool detects word boundaries from underscores, hyphens, spaces, and lowercase→uppercase transitions, so converting between any two cases works correctly."},
        {"q": "Does it run in my browser?", "a": "Yes — 100%. Your text never leaves the page. Useful for renaming variables, generating CSS class names, or normalizing identifiers without exposing them to a server."},

        {"q": "What's the difference between an attachment and embedding?", "a": "An attachment is a file stored inside the PDF that the reader can open separately. Embedding means inlining content (images, fonts) into the page itself. Use attachments when you want recipients to access the supporting file but keep the visible PDF clean."},
        {"q": "Will email clients flag attached PDFs as suspicious?", "a": "No, attachments inside a PDF aren't visible to email gateway scanners as separate attachments — the file is part of the PDF structure. Most spam filters don't flag them."},
        {"q": "How big can the embedded file be?", "a": "Up to the 500 MB total file limit. The PDF size grows by approximately the embedded file's size."},
    ],
    "add-hyperlinks": [
        {"q": "Can I link to other pages in the same PDF?", "a": "Currently the tool supports external URLs. For internal page jumps, use the Bookmarks tool instead."},
        {"q": "Are the links visible to the user?", "a": "The clickable rectangle is invisible by default. To add visible underlined link text, use the Edit PDF tool to draw the underline first."},
        {"q": "Will hyperlinks survive printing or PDF/A conversion?", "a": "Hyperlinks don't print (they're interactive annotations) but they're preserved through most PDF/A conversions. PDF/A-1a strips them; PDF/A-2 keeps them."},
    ],
    "add-shapes": [
        {"q": "Are shapes flattened into the page?", "a": "Yes — shapes become part of the page's content stream, not annotations. They can't be moved or deleted afterwards without re-editing the PDF."},
        {"q": "Can I draw filled or only outlined shapes?", "a": "Both. Set fillColor for a filled shape; omit it and only the stroke renders. Set both for an outlined fill."},
        {"q": "What about transparency?", "a": "Use a color with alpha (e.g., rgba(255,0,0,0.5)) or pass an opacity value (0–1)."},
    ],
    "alternate-mix": [
        {"q": "When would I use this?", "a": "The classic case is double-sided scanning on a single-sided scanner: scan the odd pages, flip the stack, scan the even pages in reverse, then alternate-mix them with reverse-alternate."},
        {"q": "What if the PDFs have different page counts?", "a": "PrivaTools alternates pages until one source is exhausted, then appends the remaining pages from the longer source at the end."},
        {"q": "Does this preserve bookmarks?", "a": "No. Bookmarks from the originals are dropped because they would point to incorrect pages after interleaving."},
    ],
    "annotate-pdf": [
        {"q": "Are annotations flattened?", "a": "By default no — they remain as editable annotations. If you want them permanently baked into the page, run the Flatten tool afterwards."},
        {"q": "Can I attach sticky-note comments?", "a": "Yes. Add a note annotation with author + content; readers display it as an icon that opens a popup with the text on click."},
        {"q": "Do annotations survive PDF/A conversion?", "a": "Some do (text, highlight, square) but interactive ones (file attachments, popup notes) get flattened or stripped depending on the PDF/A profile."},
    ],
    "auto-crop": [
        {"q": "Will this make text run off the page?", "a": "No — the algorithm leaves a small safety margin around detected content. If a page has no content (blank), the original MediaBox is kept."},
        {"q": "What if my PDF has different page sizes after scanning?", "a": "Auto-crop computes the bounding box per-page, so pages are independently cropped to their own content."},
        {"q": "Will this affect printing?", "a": "After auto-crop, printing produces a smaller paper size. If you need the same paper size with less margin, use the Resize tool afterwards."},
    ],
    "bates-numbering": [
        {"q": "What's Bates numbering used for?", "a": "Sequential page identification across legal discovery documents. Each page in a production gets a unique identifier so attorneys can reference exact pages."},
        {"q": "Can I start the numbering at a value other than 1?", "a": "Yes — set start_number to any positive integer. This is the standard workflow for continuing a numbering scheme across multiple production batches."},
        {"q": "Does it survive redaction?", "a": "Yes — Bates numbers are stamped directly onto the page content, so they remain after redaction (unless the redaction rectangle covers them)."},
    ],
    "bmp-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Why is the output PDF so much smaller than the BMPs?", "a": "BMP is uncompressed; PDF stores images in DCT (JPEG) or Flate format. A 5 MB BMP usually becomes a few hundred KB inside the PDF."},
        {"q": "Will quality degrade?", "a": "By default the conversion is near-lossless using high-quality JPEG. For 100% lossless, convert via PNG first (PNG-to-PDF) — slightly larger output."},
        {"q": "How many BMPs can I convert at once?", "a": "Up to the 500 MB total file limit. Several dozen images is routine."},
    ],
    "booklet-pdf": [
        {"q": "Why is the order so strange?", "a": "Saddle-stitch binding folds the sheets in half — the front cover of sheet 1 carries pages 8 and 1, the back carries pages 2 and 7. The math is fixed by binding geometry."},
        {"q": "What if my page count isn't a multiple of 4?", "a": "PrivaTools pads with blank pages at the end before computing the imposition order, so the booklet always works."},
        {"q": "Can I use this for thick books?", "a": "Saddle-stitch caps at about 80 pages (20 sheets) because the inner pages start to creep. For longer documents use perfect binding (no imposition needed)."},
    ],
    "compare-pdf": [
        {"q": "Does this work on scanned PDFs?", "a": "Only with OCR. Run OCR PDF on both files first so the text layer is present, then compare."},
        {"q": "How accurate is the text diff?", "a": "Word-level diff handles reordering, insertion, deletion, and formatting changes. Diffs based on character runs would be noisier."},
        {"q": "Can I compare more than two files?", "a": "Run Compare twice (A vs B, then B vs C) to chain a multi-revision comparison."},
    ],
    "crop-pdf": [
        {"q": "Difference between Crop and Auto-Crop?", "a": "Crop uses your manual margins (same on every page). Auto-Crop detects each page's actual content bounding box automatically."},
        {"q": "Will the cropped content be deleted from the file?", "a": "No — only the visible region changes. The full page content is still in the file. To permanently remove the cropped data, run Flatten or Sanitize afterwards."},
        {"q": "How do I undo a crop?", "a": "Re-open the PDF in PrivaTools Crop with negative margins to expand the box, or run Flatten which bakes the current crop in."},
    ],
    "delete-annotations": [
        {"q": "Will this remove form fields too?", "a": "Yes — form fields are a type of annotation. To preserve form structure but clear values, use the Fill Form tool with empty values instead."},
        {"q": "Are hyperlinks deleted?", "a": "Yes — hyperlinks are link annotations. Use this to make a PDF completely 'read-only' as a static document."},
        {"q": "Does this remove signatures?", "a": "Yes, signature annotations are removed too — which invalidates the cryptographic signature."},
    ],
    "delete-pages": [
        {"q": "What happens to bookmarks pointing to deleted pages?", "a": "They're either dropped or rewritten to the nearest remaining page, depending on outline structure. The Bookmarks tool can be used afterwards to clean them up."},
        {"q": "Can I delete page ranges?", "a": "Yes — use ranges like '5-12'. Mix single pages and ranges freely."},
        {"q": "Will the page numbers update?", "a": "Visible page numbers (added with the Page Numbers tool) stay as they were rendered. The internal page indices reflect the new order."},
    ],
    "deskew-pdf": [
        {"q": "My scans look fine — should I run deskew?", "a": "If the text appears tilted by more than ~0.5°, deskew helps OCR accuracy noticeably. For perfectly straight scans it's a no-op."},
        {"q": "Will deskew add white margins?", "a": "Yes — rotated pages need a slightly larger canvas. PrivaTools fills the margins with the surrounding background color (usually white)."},
        {"q": "Should I deskew before or after OCR?", "a": "Always before. OCR engines are much more accurate on straight-line text."},
    ],
    "esign-pdf": [
        {"q": "Is this a cryptographically valid signature?", "a": "No — this places a visual signature image, like signing paper. For cryptographically verifiable signatures, use the Sign PDF tool with a certificate."},
        {"q": "Does my signature image stay on PrivaTools?", "a": "No. It's used only to render the output PDF and is deleted immediately afterwards."},
        {"q": "Can I use a signature image I already have?", "a": "Yes — upload a transparent PNG of your signature instead of drawing one."},
    ],
    "excel-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Will my formulas be visible?", "a": "No — only computed values appear. The formulas themselves are not included (PDF has no formula concept)."},
        {"q": "What about charts and images?", "a": "Charts render as static images. Embedded images are preserved at their original size."},
        {"q": "How does it handle very wide sheets?", "a": "Wide sheets paginate across multiple PDF pages, with column headers repeated on each."},
    ],
    "extract-images": [
        {"q": "Will the images be the original resolution?", "a": "Yes. PDF embeds images at the resolution set when the PDF was created — extraction recovers them unchanged."},
        {"q": "What if the same image appears multiple times?", "a": "Each visual occurrence is extracted, even if it's the same underlying image data. Use deduplication after if needed."},
        {"q": "Does it work on scanned PDFs?", "a": "Yes — each page of a scanned PDF is one big image. The tool extracts that page-image directly."},
    ],
    "extract-pages": [
        {"q": "How is this different from Delete Pages?", "a": "Extract keeps the listed pages; Delete removes them. They're complementary — use whichever produces less typing."},
        {"q": "Can I extract pages into separate files?", "a": "For one-file-per-page splitting, use the Split PDF tool with 'individual' mode."},
        {"q": "Does this preserve bookmarks?", "a": "Bookmarks pointing to kept pages are preserved; those pointing to dropped pages are removed."},
    ],
    "fill-form": [
        {"q": "How do I know what the form field names are?", "a": "Use the /api/fill-form/fields endpoint (or paste-then-inspect): PrivaTools returns the list of field names, types, and current values without filling anything."},
        {"q": "Can I flatten the filled form?", "a": "Yes — run the Flatten tool afterwards to bake the values into the page content so they can't be edited."},
        {"q": "Does this work on signed forms?", "a": "Filling a signed form invalidates the signature. Sign last, after filling."},
    ],
    "gif-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Do animated GIFs animate inside the PDF?", "a": "No — PDF doesn't support animation. Only the first frame is used. To convert animation to PDF, use GIF to MP4 then Video to PDF for keyframes."},
        {"q": "How is transparency handled?", "a": "GIF transparent pixels render against a white page background. Use PNG-to-PDF if you need true alpha."},
        {"q": "Can the GIF stay as a GIF inside the PDF?", "a": "PDF doesn't natively support GIF — the image is re-encoded as JPEG or Flate during embedding."},
    ],
    "grayscale-pdf": [
        {"q": "Will text still be searchable?", "a": "Yes — the text layer is preserved. Only the rendered visuals change to grayscale."},
        {"q": "Why convert to grayscale?", "a": "Cheaper printing on black-and-white printers, smaller file size, accessibility for color-blind readers, archival storage."},
        {"q": "How does this differ from black-and-white?", "a": "Grayscale preserves shading (256 grey levels). True black-and-white (1-bit) is harsher but smaller — not currently offered as a separate option."},
    ],
    "header-footer": [
        {"q": "Will the header/footer overlap existing content?", "a": "It might if your pages have content close to the edges. Use the Crop or Resize tool first to add margin space if needed."},
        {"q": "Can I exclude the cover page?", "a": "Pages-to-affect parameter accepts ranges like '2-' to skip the first page or '2-N-1' to skip first + last."},
        {"q": "Are these editable annotations or baked-in?", "a": "Baked into the page content. They can't be removed without re-editing — use Whiteout to cover them if needed later."},
    ],
    "heic-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Will the PDF be much larger than the HEIC?", "a": "Yes — HEIC is more efficient than JPEG. The PDF uses JPEG internally and is typically 2-3x the size of the source HEICs."},
        {"q": "Does this preserve image quality?", "a": "Default JPEG quality is 90, which is visually indistinguishable. Lossless would require PNG-to-PDF and produce much larger files."},
        {"q": "What happens to GPS metadata?", "a": "Stripped during conversion. Use View EXIF first if you want to record GPS coordinates before they're gone."},
    ],
    "invert-colors": [
        {"q": "Why would I invert colors?", "a": "Dark-mode reading on tablets, contrast-flipped scanning of light text on dark backgrounds, or accessibility for users sensitive to bright whites."},
        {"q": "Will the text still be searchable after?", "a": "Inverted pages become images, so the text layer is lost. To preserve searchability, OCR the inverted PDF afterwards."},
        {"q": "Can I invert only certain pages?", "a": "Currently inversion applies to all pages. Run Extract Pages → Invert → Merge to apply selectively."},
    ],
    "jpg-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Will my photos lose quality?", "a": "Quality is preserved — JPGs are embedded as-is into the PDF. The PDF wrapper adds about 5% overhead."},
        {"q": "Can I reorder the photos before conversion?", "a": "Yes — drag the thumbnails to your desired order before clicking Convert."},
        {"q": "Does this preserve EXIF metadata?", "a": "GPS and camera metadata are stripped by default for privacy. PDF metadata (title, author) can be set separately with the Update Metadata tool."},
    ],
    "markdown-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Are images included?", "a": "Local image references in the Markdown are inlined if they're in the same upload; remote URLs are fetched at render time."},
        {"q": "Can I customize the styling?", "a": "Not yet — the default style is GitHub-inspired (clean serif body, monospace code). Custom CSS is on the roadmap."},
        {"q": "Does it handle code-block syntax highlighting?", "a": "Yes — fenced code blocks with language hints get tokenized and colored (Python, JS, SQL, Bash, etc.)."},
    ],
    "metadata": [
        {"q": "What metadata does a typical PDF carry?", "a": "At minimum: producer (the software that created it) and creation date. Often also: author name, original filename, software version. Scanned PDFs may carry scanner model + driver."},
        {"q": "Why does this matter for privacy?", "a": "Producer + Creator + Author fields can identify the person or machine that created a document — useful in forensics, problematic for whistleblowers."},
        {"q": "Is XMP metadata shown too?", "a": "Yes — both the Info dictionary (old format) and XMP stream (new format) are inspected."},
    ],
    "nup": [
        {"q": "Why is this called 'N-up'?", "a": "Print-industry terminology: '2-up' = 2 pages per sheet, '4-up' = 4 per sheet, etc. Saves paper and ink for review prints."},
        {"q": "Are page numbers preserved?", "a": "Original page numbers (rendered on the page) shrink with the page. Add new page numbers afterwards if you need them readable."},
        {"q": "What aspect ratio works best?", "a": "2-up and 8-up work well for landscape, 4-up and 9-up for portrait. Mismatches add whitespace around each sub-page."},
    ],
    "odt-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "What about ODT-specific features (math equations, drawings)?", "a": "OpenDocument math (Formula) and drawings render correctly as the LibreOffice converter handles them natively."},
        {"q": "Will fonts that aren't on the server cause problems?", "a": "Missing fonts get substituted. Embedded fonts in the ODT are honored."},
        {"q": "Does it handle macros?", "a": "Macros are not executed — only the static document content is converted."},
    ],
    "organize-pages": [
        {"q": "Can I rotate individual pages independently?", "a": "Yes — each thumbnail has its own rotate button. Rotations are 90° clockwise / counter-clockwise / 180°."},
        {"q": "How is this different from Extract Pages?", "a": "Extract keeps a subset in original order. Organize lets you reorder, duplicate, rotate, and delete all in one pass."},
        {"q": "Does it preserve bookmarks?", "a": "Bookmarks targeting deleted pages are removed; targeting reordered pages, they follow to the new position."},
    ],
    "overlay": [
        {"q": "What's the difference between overlay and merge?", "a": "Merge concatenates files page-by-page. Overlay composites pages on top of each other — useful for adding letterheads, watermarks-from-PDF, or repeating templates."},
        {"q": "Can I overlay only some pages?", "a": "By default it applies cycle-wise: if the overlay has 3 pages and the base has 10, the overlay repeats. For one-time overlay, use a base + overlay of equal length."},
        {"q": "Does transparency work?", "a": "Yes — PDF supports transparency and the overlay's alpha is honored. White rectangles still cover what's beneath; transparent regions show base content through."},
    ],
    "page-numbers": [
        {"q": "Can I use Roman numerals or letters?", "a": "Currently Arabic digits only. Roman / alpha numbering is on the roadmap."},
        {"q": "How is this different from Bates numbering?", "a": "Page numbers are simple sequential digits. Bates numbers have a prefix, configurable padding, and are used in legal contexts."},
        {"q": "Can I start from a specific page?", "a": "Yes — pages-to-affect lets you specify a starting page (e.g. exclude cover + TOC)."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-bmp": [
        {"q": "Why are BMPs so much larger than PNG?", "a": "BMP stores every pixel uncompressed. PNG losslessly compresses to ~20% the size. Use BMP only when you specifically need uncompressed pixel data."},
        {"q": "What's BMP good for?", "a": "Legacy Windows software that doesn't support modern formats; embedded systems; precise pixel manipulation."},
        {"q": "Can I get just one page as BMP?", "a": "Extract that page first with Extract Pages, then convert."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-epub": [
        {"q": "How accurate is the EPUB compared to the PDF?", "a": "Text and basic structure transfer well. Complex multi-column layouts, footnotes, and figure captions may need cleanup in calibre."},
        {"q": "Does it preserve images?", "a": "Yes — embedded images are included as EPUB resources at original resolution."},
        {"q": "Will the table of contents work?", "a": "If the PDF has bookmarks, they become the EPUB's TOC. Without bookmarks, the TOC is built from detected headings."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-gif": [
        {"q": "Will the GIFs look good?", "a": "GIF's 256-color palette quantizes the page. Text remains readable but gradients and photos show banding. Use PNG for higher quality."},
        {"q": "Does this make an animated GIF?", "a": "No — each page is one static GIF. To make a flipbook-style animation, use Video to GIF after converting to images and back."},
        {"q": "How big are the output files?", "a": "Typically 30-100 KB per page at 96 DPI."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-jpg": [
        {"q": "Why JPG instead of PNG?", "a": "JPG is smaller for photos and scanned content. Use PNG-to-PDF if your PDF has crisp text or graphics where compression artifacts would show."},
        {"q": "What about transparency?", "a": "JPG doesn't support transparency. White pages render as white; transparent regions become white."},
        {"q": "How long does it take?", "a": "Roughly 50-100 ms per page at 150 DPI. A 100-page PDF takes ~10 seconds."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-markdown": [
        {"q": "How accurate is the structural detection?", "a": "Headings work well when source fonts are larger. Tables transfer if cells are clearly separated. Code-block detection is a heuristic — manual review recommended."},
        {"q": "What about images?", "a": "Images are extracted to a sibling folder and referenced by Markdown image syntax."},
        {"q": "Will hyperlinks be preserved?", "a": "Yes — PDF hyperlinks become Markdown links."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-png": [
        {"q": "Why PNG instead of JPG?", "a": "PNG is lossless — text and graphics stay crisp. JPG compresses better for photos but introduces compression artifacts on text."},
        {"q": "How big are the PNGs?", "a": "Roughly 200-500 KB per page at 150 DPI for typical text content; up to 2-3 MB at 300 DPI."},
        {"q": "Does this preserve PDF transparency?", "a": "PDF transparency layers flatten during rasterization but the result PNG has alpha if the PDF page had transparent regions over the page background."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-pptx": [
        {"q": "Will the text be editable in PowerPoint?", "a": "The extracted text overlay is editable. The underlying page image stays as a backdrop. For pixel-perfect editing, you may need to remove the backdrop and rebuild from the text."},
        {"q": "What about embedded charts and graphics?", "a": "They appear as part of the page image. Re-creating editable charts requires manual recreation in PowerPoint."},
        {"q": "Can I get one slide per section instead of per page?", "a": "Not directly — use Extract Pages to isolate the sections first, then convert."},
    ],
    "pdf-to-tiff": [
        {"q": "Why TIFF for archival?", "a": "TIFF supports lossless compression (LZW, Deflate) and is the format of choice for long-term preservation in libraries and government archives."},
        {"q": "Single multi-page TIFF or one per page?", "a": "Default is multi-page TIFF for compact archiving. Use the per-page option for compatibility with software that only reads single-page TIFFs."},
        {"q": "Does it preserve text searchability?", "a": "TIFF is raster only — the text layer is lost. Use Sanitize PDF or PDF/A for archive while keeping text searchable."},
    ],
    "pdfa-validator": [
        {"q": "What is PDF/A and why does it matter?", "a": "PDF/A is an ISO standard for long-term archival. It requires self-contained PDFs (all fonts embedded, no external scripts, no encryption) so the document will render identically in 50 years."},
        {"q": "What's the difference between PDF/A-1, A-2, A-3?", "a": "A-1 is the strictest (no transparency, no XFA forms). A-2 adds transparency, JPEG 2000, and PDF attachments. A-3 allows arbitrary file attachments — useful for invoice + machine-readable data bundles."},
        {"q": "If it's not PDF/A, can I convert it?", "a": "Yes — use the PDF to PDF/A tool which fixes the most common issues automatically (font embedding, color profile attachment)."},
    ],
    "png-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Will the PDF be larger than the PNGs?", "a": "Roughly the same — PNGs are already losslessly compressed, and PDF embeds them with minimal overhead."},
        {"q": "How is transparency handled?", "a": "Transparent PNGs render over a white background. If you need true alpha through, use the Image to PDF generic tool with the keep-alpha option."},
        {"q": "Is there a max number of images?", "a": "Practical limit is around 100 images per conversion before browser upload time becomes inconvenient. Backend limit is 500 MB total."},
    ],
    "pptx-to-pdf-convert": [
        {"q": "Will animations be preserved?", "a": "PDF doesn't support animation. Each slide renders in its initial state. For animation, export to video first."},
        {"q": "How are speaker notes handled?", "a": "Notes are not included in the PDF by default. We don't currently offer a 'with notes' option but it's on the roadmap."},
        {"q": "What about embedded videos?", "a": "Videos render as a poster frame (the first frame). Use Extract Audio + Video to PDF for video-centric conversion."},
    ],
    "qr-code": [
        {"q": "Can I customize colors?", "a": "Currently black-on-white only. Custom colors and logos in the center are on the roadmap."},
        {"q": "How do I encode a URL with parameters?", "a": "Just paste the full URL. Special characters are encoded automatically inside the QR."},
        {"q": "What's the maximum data I can encode?", "a": "Around 2,500 alphanumeric characters or 4,000 numeric digits at error correction level L. Higher EC levels reduce capacity."},
    ],
    "remove-blank-pages": [
        {"q": "How does it detect 'blank'?", "a": "Each page is rendered to a low-res raster and analysed for pixel density. Pages with less than (100 - sensitivity)% non-white pixels are marked for removal."},
        {"q": "Will pages with only a page number get deleted?", "a": "Depends on sensitivity. At sensitivity 95 (default), pages with isolated tiny content like page numbers are kept. At sensitivity 80, they may be removed."},
        {"q": "What if a page has only a watermark?", "a": "The watermark counts as content. Use sensitivity 99 to only remove pages with no content at all."},
    ],
    "repair-pdf": [
        {"q": "What kinds of damage can it fix?", "a": "Missing or corrupt cross-reference tables, broken trailers, dangling object references, slightly-truncated streams. Cannot recover from missing object data."},
        {"q": "Will the repaired PDF look identical?", "a": "Yes if the damage was in metadata/structure. Visible content damage (cropped images, missing fonts) requires the original to fix."},
        {"q": "Can it merge two damaged PDFs?", "a": "Repair each separately first, then use Merge."},
    ],
    "resize-pdf": [
        {"q": "Will my content be cropped if I resize to a smaller page?", "a": "No — content scales proportionally. If you want to crop instead, use the Crop tool."},
        {"q": "Difference between Resize and Crop?", "a": "Resize changes the page dimensions (scales content). Crop changes the visible region without scaling."},
        {"q": "Does this affect text quality?", "a": "Text is vector-based in PDFs, so it scales perfectly. Only embedded raster images can lose quality on extreme upscale."},

    "reverse-pdf": [
        {"q": "When would I use this?", "a": "Most common: rescue a scan where pages came out in reverse order. Also: countdown PDFs (10, 9, 8…), reverse-chronological logs."},
        {"q": "Are bookmarks updated?", "a": "Yes — bookmarks pointing to page N are rewritten to point to page (total - N + 1)."},
        {"q": "Will visible page numbers update?", "a": "Page numbers stamped with the Page Numbers tool are part of page content; they don't auto-update. Reverse first, then re-add page numbers."},
    ],
    "rtf-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "What about RTF features like fields?", "a": "Calculated fields (page numbers, dates) render as their current values. Form fields aren't converted to PDF form fields — use Form Creator for that."},
        {"q": "Does it preserve fonts?", "a": "Fonts referenced in the RTF are matched to server-installed fonts. Missing fonts fall back to a close visual equivalent."},
        {"q": "How does this differ from DOCX-to-PDF?", "a": "RTF is an older Microsoft format. DOCX is a newer ZIP-based format. Both convert similarly but DOCX preserves more layout fidelity."},
    ],
    "sanitize-pdf": [
        {"q": "What is sanitization protecting against?", "a": "Malicious PDFs that exploit reader vulnerabilities through embedded scripts or auto-launching attachments. Most modern readers are hardened against these, but defense in depth is wise."},
        {"q": "Does this remove form fields?", "a": "No — form fields are kept (just JavaScript actions on them are stripped). Use Flatten or Delete Annotations to remove form structure."},
        {"q": "Are hyperlinks removed?", "a": "Plain http/https links are kept. Links using non-web URI schemes (file:, mailto: with auto-execute, etc.) are stripped."},
    ],
    "set-permissions": [
        {"q": "What's the difference between owner password and user password?", "a": "User password = required to OPEN. Owner password = required to override permissions (print, edit). Use Protect PDF for both; this tool sets only the owner password + permission flags."},
        {"q": "How strong is the protection?", "a": "It's enforced by readers as a courtesy — Adobe Acrobat respects it strictly, some open-source readers ignore it. For real security, encrypt with a user password."},
        {"q": "Can users still copy text?", "a": "Only if allow_copy is true. If false, the reader disables text selection. Note: screenshots still work (no PDF protection can prevent that)."},
    ],
    "split-by-bookmarks": [
        {"q": "What if the PDF has no bookmarks?", "a": "The tool returns an error. Use the regular Split tool or the new Split by Text tool which doesn't need bookmarks."},
        {"q": "Does it use nested sub-bookmarks?", "a": "No — only top-level bookmarks define split points. Sub-sections stay within their parent chapter PDF."},
        {"q": "Can I include the bookmark title as the PDF title?", "a": "Each output PDF inherits its starting bookmark's title as the file name. The internal PDF Title metadata is set to match."},
    ],
    "stamp-pdf": [
        {"q": "Are stamps editable annotations or baked-in?", "a": "Baked into the page content. They survive copying, printing, and PDF/A conversion. To remove, use Whiteout to cover them."},
        {"q": "Can I apply a stamp to only specific pages?", "a": "Yes — pages parameter accepts page ranges like '1-3' or 'all'."},
        {"q": "How big is the stamp?", "a": "Auto-sized to roughly 60% of page width with the chosen opacity for visibility without obscuring content."},
    ],
    "strip-metadata": [
        {"q": "Why strip metadata?", "a": "Author / producer / original-filename fields can identify who created or owns a document — a privacy concern for whistleblowers, journalists, or before public release."},
        {"q": "What about embedded images' EXIF?", "a": "Image-level EXIF inside PDF embedded images is also stripped. The image pixel data is unchanged."},
        {"q": "Is this the same as Sanitize?", "a": "No — Strip Metadata removes informational fields. Sanitize removes security-risky elements (JavaScript, auto-launch attachments)."},
    ],
    "svg-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Will my SVG stay as vector inside the PDF?", "a": "Yes — PDF natively supports vector content, so paths, text, and gradients remain editable at any zoom level."},
        {"q": "What about embedded raster images inside SVG?", "a": "Embedded raster images (data URLs, external image refs) are preserved as raster within the PDF."},
        {"q": "Does it handle CSS styles inside SVG?", "a": "Standard SVG CSS (fill, stroke, opacity, transform) is honored. External stylesheet refs are inlined first."},
    ],
    "tiff-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Will quality be preserved?", "a": "Yes — TIFF is lossless. PDF uses Flate (lossless) or JPEG (near-lossless) when embedding. Default is high-quality JPEG to keep file size reasonable."},
        {"q": "What about CMYK TIFFs (for print)?", "a": "CMYK is preserved through to the PDF. Use this workflow for prepress / professional printing pipelines."},
        {"q": "How are multi-page TIFFs handled?", "a": "Each TIFF page becomes a PDF page in order. Multiple multi-page TIFFs in one upload are concatenated."},
    ],
    "transparent-background": [
        {"q": "Will text be affected?", "a": "Black text is preserved. Light grey or low-contrast text near the threshold may become semi-transparent — lower the threshold (e.g. 220) to be more aggressive about preserving content."},
        {"q": "What's the output format?", "a": "PDF with transparent regions where the background was. Open in a reader to see the underlying canvas show through."},
        {"q": "Can I use this on photos?", "a": "It works best on text/diagram documents with clean backgrounds. Photos with light skies become weirdly transparent — use Remove Background (rembg) for photos."},
    ],
    "verify-signature": [
        {"q": "Does this require uploading my certificates?", "a": "No — verification uses the certificates embedded in the PDF itself, plus the system's trusted CA store."},
        {"q": "What if a signature is invalid?", "a": "The report says exactly why: content modified, certificate expired, untrusted issuer, or signature format unsupported. The PDF itself isn't rejected — just the signature."},
        {"q": "Can I verify multiple signatures?", "a": "Yes — PDFs can have multiple signatures (e.g. one per signing party). All are verified independently."},
    ],
    "webp-to-pdf": [
        {"q": "Will the PDF be much smaller than from JPG?", "a": "Slightly smaller — WebP-derived JPEGs inside PDF are similar to direct JPGs. The main benefit was at upload time (smaller WebP files)."},
        {"q": "What about animated WebP?", "a": "Only the first frame is used. PDF doesn't support animation."},
        {"q": "Does this preserve transparency?", "a": "PDF supports transparency but most readers render text-on-transparency oddly. We default to compositing over white for best compatibility."},
    ],
    "whiteout-pdf": [
        {"q": "Is whiteout the same as redaction?", "a": "No — whiteout covers content visually but the underlying text remains in the file. For permanent redaction (text removed), use Redact PDF or Smart Redact."},
        {"q": "Can I use any color, not just white?", "a": "Yes — color is configurable. Black for blackout style, white for whiteout, any custom hex color for matching background."},
        {"q": "Does it work on scanned PDFs?", "a": "Yes — the cover rectangle is added on top of the rendered page. Behind, the original pixels are still in the file."},
    ],
    "add-subtitles": [
        {"q": "Should I burn-in or use a soft subtitle track?", "a": "Burn-in: best for social media (Twitter, Instagram) where players don't render subtitle tracks. Soft: best for accessibility — viewers can turn off."},
        {"q": "What subtitle formats are supported?", "a": "Input: SRT. Burn-in output: works in any video player. Soft track: MP4 with WebVTT or MKV with SRT — depending on output format."},
        {"q": "Can I customize the font / size / color?", "a": "Currently uses sensible defaults (white text with black outline, sans-serif). Custom styling is on the roadmap."},
    ],
    "audio-merge": [
        {"q": "What if my files have different sample rates?", "a": "FFmpeg resamples to a common rate (usually 44.1 kHz) automatically. There may be a tiny re-encoding loss; for lossless concatenation use FLAC inputs."},
        {"q": "Are gaps between tracks added?", "a": "No — files are concatenated seamlessly. To add silence, prepare it as a separate file with the same format and insert it in the order."},
        {"q": "Maximum total length?", "a": "Practical limit is whatever fits inside the 500 MB output. Hours of MP3 at moderate bitrate is fine."},
    ],
    "color-converter": [
        {"q": "Does it work with alpha (transparency)?", "a": "Yes — paste #RRGGBBAA or rgba(...) and the alpha channel is preserved across all output formats."},
        {"q": "Why does my CMYK look different from print?", "a": "CMYK conversion uses a sRGB → CMYK approximation. For exact print color, use your printer's color profile."},
        {"q": "Is the calculation done locally?", "a": "Yes — pure browser JavaScript. No network requests."},
    ],
    "create-zip": [
        {"q": "Is the password protection strong?", "a": "Yes — AES-256 is the modern standard. The legacy ZipCrypto algorithm is NOT used."},
        {"q": "Will it preserve folder structure?", "a": "Uploaded files are placed at the root of the archive. To preserve a folder structure, upload them folder-by-folder using the multi-folder option."},
        {"q": "What if I forget the password?", "a": "There is no recovery — AES-256 has no backdoor. Lost password = lost archive content."},
    ],
    "csv-json": [
        {"q": "How does CSV escaping work?", "a": "Standard RFC 4180: commas in values must be quoted; quotes inside values are doubled (\"\"). PrivaTools handles both."},
        {"q": "What about nested JSON?", "a": "Nested objects are flattened to dot-notation columns (user.name, user.email) for CSV output. Reverse direction reconstructs the nesting."},
        {"q": "Will my data be uploaded?", "a": "No — pure-browser conversion. No data leaves your machine."},
    ],
    "extract-archive": [
        {"q": "What about password-protected archives?", "a": "Password input is supported — paste the password and the encrypted archive is decrypted before extraction."},
        {"q": "Does it support RAR / 7z?", "a": "Currently only ZIP. RAR / 7z support is on the roadmap."},
        {"q": "What if the archive contains many small files?", "a": "Up to 1000 files per archive. For larger, split before zipping."},
    ],
    "extract-audio": [
        {"q": "Will quality be preserved?", "a": "WAV/FLAC are lossless. MP3/AAC at 192 kbps+ is transparent for most listeners. Lower bitrates lose quality."},
        {"q": "What if the video has multiple audio tracks?", "a": "PrivaTools extracts the first/default audio track. Multi-track extraction is on the roadmap."},
        {"q": "Can I extract just a section of the audio?", "a": "Use Trim Media first to isolate the section, then extract audio from the trimmed video."},
    ],
    "generate-barcode": [
        {"q": "What barcode type for a URL?", "a": "Use QR code — barcodes like Code 128 work for text but are much wider for the same content."},
        {"q": "Will it scan reliably?", "a": "Yes — barcodes are rendered at the standard 2D module size. Printed at 100% on a regular printer, any standard scanner reads them."},
        {"q": "Can I include a check digit?", "a": "EAN-13 and UPC-A auto-calculate the check digit. Code 128 has a built-in checksum. Code 39 supports optional checksums."},
    ],
    "generate-favicon": [
        {"q": "Do I need all those sizes?", "a": "Yes — different browsers and devices use different sizes (16×16 for tabs, 192×192 for Android home screen, 512×512 for PWA install)."},
        {"q": "Should I use PNG or SVG source?", "a": "SVG is best — it stays sharp at every size. PNG works if you only have a raster logo. JPG loses some sharpness from compression."},
        {"q": "Will my logo become circular?", "a": "No — favicons render exactly as uploaded. To get a circular look, upload a circular PNG with transparency."},
    ],
    "gif-to-mp4": [
        {"q": "Why convert GIF to MP4?", "a": "MP4 is dramatically smaller (better compression), supports audio, and plays smoother. Most social platforms now auto-convert uploaded GIFs to MP4 anyway."},
        {"q": "Will the loop work in MP4?", "a": "MP4 doesn't have built-in loop info — players decide. Embed with <video loop autoplay muted> to mimic GIF behavior on the web."},
        {"q": "Does it preserve transparency?", "a": "MP4 doesn't support transparency. Transparent pixels render against a black background. Use WebM with VP9 if you need alpha."},
    ],
    "hash-generator": [
        {"q": "Is MD5 safe to use?", "a": "For non-security purposes (file integrity, deduplication): yes. For security (passwords, signatures): no — MD5 is broken. Use SHA-256 or SHA-512."},
        {"q": "Why are file hashes useful?", "a": "Verifying file integrity after download, deduplication, change detection, content-addressed storage."},
        {"q": "Is the hash calculation done in the browser?", "a": "Yes — Web Crypto API runs the hash in your browser. Files are not uploaded."},
    ],
    "image-converter": [
        {"q": "Which format is best for what?", "a": "PNG for graphics with transparency. JPG for photos. WebP for web (smaller). TIFF for archival. HEIC for iPhone storage (limited compatibility)."},
        {"q": "Does it preserve EXIF metadata?", "a": "Stripped during conversion. Use View EXIF first to record any GPS or camera data you want to keep."},
        {"q": "Can I batch-convert?", "a": "Currently one image at a time. For batch, use the format-specific aliases (jpg-to-pdf, etc.) which accept multiple files."},
    ],
    "image-ocr": [
        {"q": "How accurate is the OCR?", "a": "Tesseract handles clean printed text very well (98%+). Handwriting, low-resolution, or low-contrast images are harder."},
        {"q": "Should I preprocess the image first?", "a": "Deskew helps a lot for tilted scans. Convert to grayscale doesn't help (Tesseract converts internally)."},
        {"q": "What about handwriting?", "a": "Tesseract is trained on print. Use a specialized handwriting OCR for cursive."},
    ],
    "image-watermark": [
        {"q": "Can I watermark with an image instead of text?", "a": "Currently text-only watermarks. Image watermarks (logo overlay) are on the roadmap."},
        {"q": "Is the watermark removable?", "a": "Depends on placement. Watermarks over high-detail areas are harder to remove than over solid backgrounds. AI inpainting tools can sometimes erase them — for stronger protection, use diagonal repeating patterns."},
        {"q": "Does it affect image quality?", "a": "Negligibly. Output is at the same JPEG quality as input."},
    ],
    "json-xml-formatter": [
        {"q": "Will it validate the input?", "a": "Yes — invalid JSON / XML shows an error with the line and column. Common errors (trailing commas, unclosed strings, mismatched tags) are highlighted."},
        {"q": "Can it convert JSON ↔ XML?", "a": "This tool only formats. For conversion, paste into the CSV/JSON converter or use a dedicated converter."},

    ],
    "lorem-ipsum": [
        {"q": "Why use Lorem Ipsum and not English?", "a": "It has roughly Latin letter frequencies so designs feel real, without distracting reviewers with the actual content. English placeholder text always gets read instead of looked at."},
        {"q": "Can I get other languages?", "a": "Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, and CJK placeholder texts are on the roadmap."},

    ],
    "make-collage": [
        {"q": "Will images be resized?", "a": "Each image is scaled to fit its grid cell while preserving aspect ratio. To force same aspect ratio, crop them first with Resize Crop Image."},
        {"q": "Can I rearrange the images?", "a": "Drag in the upload area to reorder. They fill left-to-right, top-to-bottom."},
        {"q": "What's the max grid size?", "a": "Tested up to 100 images. Output JPEG can be up to 30,000 pixels wide before browser limits."},

        {"q": "What about extensions like tables and code blocks?", "a": "GitHub-flavored Markdown extensions are supported in both directions: tables, fenced code, strikethrough, task lists."},
        {"q": "Will inline CSS be preserved?", "a": "Conversion is opinionated — visible content keeps semantics, but custom CSS is stripped. For a faithful HTML→PDF, use the Markdown-to-PDF tool instead."},
        {"q": "Is the conversion lossless?", "a": "HTML → Markdown can lose nesting fidelity (deeply-nested divs flatten). Markdown → HTML is exact."},
    ],
    "merge-images": [
        {"q": "Will images be cropped?", "a": "No — they're scaled to a common dimension (width for vertical, height for horizontal). Smaller images upscale; larger images downscale."},
        {"q": "What if my images have different aspect ratios?", "a": "They get letterboxed (transparent padding) to fit. Use Resize Crop Image first to force a common aspect ratio."},
        {"q": "Difference from Make Collage?", "a": "Merge concatenates in a single row or column. Collage arranges in a grid with configurable columns."},
    ],
    "password-generator": [
        {"q": "How strong is the password?", "a": "Length 20 with mixed classes ≈ 130 bits of entropy — uncrackable by brute force. Length 12 ≈ 78 bits — still very strong."},
        {"q": "Why exclude ambiguous characters?", "a": "Visual confusion: l vs 1 vs I, 0 vs O. Excluding them makes the password easier to type / read aloud at the cost of slightly less entropy."},
        {"q": "Is it really random?", "a": "Yes — Web Crypto's getRandomValues uses the OS's cryptographically secure RNG (e.g. /dev/urandom on Linux, BCryptGenRandom on Windows)."},
    ],
    "qr-reader": [
        {"q": "Can it read damaged QR codes?", "a": "QR codes have built-in error correction (up to 30%). Slightly damaged codes still read; heavily damaged ones fail."},
        {"q": "Multiple QR codes in one image?", "a": "All detected QR codes are returned with their position. Useful for batch scanning of labels."},
        {"q": "What about other barcode types?", "a": "pyzbar also reads Code 128, Code 39, EAN-13, UPC-A, etc. The decoder identifies the type automatically."},

    "subtitle-converter": [
        {"q": "What's the difference between SRT and VTT?", "a": "SRT: simplest. VTT (WebVTT): used by HTML5 <track>, supports styling. ASS (Advanced SubStation Alpha): rich styling like karaoke colors, but less compatible."},
        {"q": "Will styling carry over?", "a": "SRT → VTT: yes. VTT → SRT: styling is stripped (SRT has no style support). ASS → SRT: styling lost; text and timing preserved."},

    ],
    "svg-to-png": [
        {"q": "Why convert SVG to PNG?", "a": "PNG is universally supported (email, legacy apps, social media uploads). SVG can break in tools that don't render it (Gmail, some Slack clients)."},
        {"q": "How large should the output be?", "a": "For social media: 1200×630 (use Resize Crop Image after). For app icons: 1024×1024 base. For web retina: 2x your design size."},
        {"q": "Does it preserve transparency?", "a": "Yes — SVG transparency translates to PNG alpha. The PNG is fully alpha-channel."},

    "url-encoder": [
        {"q": "What's the difference between URL encoding and base64?", "a": "URL encoding only escapes characters that have special meaning in URLs. Base64 encodes any binary as ASCII (longer but binary-safe). Use Base64 for arbitrary data."},
        {"q": "Why decode a JWT here?", "a": "All in your browser — never paste a real production JWT into a server-side decoder. The standalone JWT Decoder tool shows expiry and claim details too."},

    "uuid-generator": [
        {"q": "What's the difference between v4 and v7?", "a": "v4 is purely random — unsortable. v7 (new in 2024) embeds a timestamp prefix so UUIDs sort chronologically. Use v7 for database primary keys."},
        {"q": "How likely is a collision?", "a": "v4 collision after generating 2^61 ≈ 2.3 quintillion UUIDs. Practically impossible."},
