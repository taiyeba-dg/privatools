# Changelog

All notable changes to PrivaTools will be documented in this file.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-05-16 — UX polish + a11y + AEO/GEO push

### 🆕 New tools (2) — total now 179

- **Rotate Image** (`/tools/rotate-image`) — 90 / 180 / 270 / arbitrary angle via Pillow `Transpose` + `rotate(expand=True)`. Canvas auto-expands so nothing is cropped at non-right angles. Transparency preserved for PNG and WEBP.
- **Flip Image** (`/tools/flip-image`) — horizontal or vertical mirror.

### 🔍 SEO / AEO / GEO

- **Blog index, About, Compare hub, Privacy, Terms, Pipeline, Batch** — 7 pages that had no JSON-LD now have proper schema (`Blog` + `BlogPosting` list, `AboutPage` + `FAQPage`, `CollectionPage` + `ItemList`, `WebPage`, `WebApplication`, `BreadcrumbList`).
- **Homepage `FAQPage`** added with 6 voice-friendly Q&As, matched by visible SSR `<h3>/<p>` so Google's FAQ rich-result rules hold.
- **Homepage SSR** now explicitly surfaces **Pipeline** and **Batch** as differentiators that no competitor offers free.
- **`llms-full.txt`** (66 KB) added alongside `/llms.txt`. Verbose per-tool reference, architecture explainer, and citation-ready statements for AI crawlers. `robots.txt` advertises both.
- Stale "152+ / 90+ / 105 / 141+" tool counts swept across `LandingPage`, `ComparePage`, `DynamicHead`, `opensearch.xml`, `manifest.json`, and the Foxit compare meta — all now use dynamic counts or the current canonical number.

### ♿ Accessibility

- **Real skip-link** in `EditorialMasthead` (`sr-only focus:not-sr-only`) jumping to `#main-content`. `id="main-content"` added to `<main>` across all 12 page components. Index.html SSR fallback skip-link harmonised to the same target.
- **`inputMode="numeric"`** added to all 48 `type="number"` inputs across 19 tool components → triggers numeric keypad on mobile.

### 🐛 Bugs

- **File inputs across 60+ components** now reset `e.target.value = ""` in `onChange`. Re-selecting the same file after clearing it (X button or post-process) used to silently no-op because the browser short-circuits `onChange` on identical values.
- **404 page rebuilt** with a fuzzy match over all 179 tools against the requested URL's last segment — surfaces a top-6 "Did you mean…" list and a Cmd-K trigger. Tool count is now dynamic.

### ⌨️ UX

- **Command Palette: category chips** (PDF / Image / Video-Audio / Dev / Docs / Archive) shown on the right of each result for disambiguation when two tools share a name. Hidden on mobile to keep rows uncluttered.
- **Cmd-K synonyms** added for `rotate-image` (turn / spin / tilt / sideways) and `flip-image` (mirror / unmirror / selfie / reflect).

## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-15 — Phase 7: competitor-gap tools

### 🆕 New tools (6) — total now 177

Six tools competitors offer that PrivaTools didn't:

- **Mute Video** — stream-copy strips the audio track (lossless, instant) — MP4 / MOV / WebM / MKV / AVI
- **Reverse Video** — plays backwards with audio reversed in sync, output H.264 + AAC
- **Video Speed Changer** — 0.25× (slow-mo) to 4× (hyperlapse), audio pitch-corrected via FFmpeg's `atempo` so it doesn't sound chipmunk-y
- **Audio Trimmer** — standalone audio cutter, lossless stream-copy on MP3 / WAV / AAC / FLAC / OGG / M4A
- **Image Color Palette** — extract dominant colours from any image with HEX codes, `rgb()` values, and coverage percentages (octree quantisation)
- **Pixelate / Blur Image** — mosaic pixelation or Gaussian blur with adjustable strength for privacy-safe sharing (block faces, license plates, addresses)

### ⌨️ Discoverability

- **Command Palette rewrite** — multi-token fuzzy scoring with 6-tier rank (exact name → prefix → slug-exact → contains → synonym phrase → multi-token AND) plus a popularity tie-breaker. `SYNONYMS` map tripled from 39 entries to 145+. Result cap 12 → 16. Verified 16/18 (89%) fuzzy match rate on test queries.

### 💬 UX

- **Human-readable HTTP errors** in `lib/api.ts` — `describeError()` maps 413 / 415 / 422 / 429 / 502 / 503 / 504 each to tailored user-facing copy instead of `Request failed (500)`. The error card got a "Try again" + "Copy error" affordance.
- **Filename preservation** across server-side tools — output filenames are derived from the source name + a suffix (`document.pdf` → `document_compressed.pdf`), not generic `output.pdf`.

### 🔍 SEO / AEO / GEO

- **Hand-written TL;DRs expanded from 30 to 141 tools** with voice-friendly, 1-2 sentence answers tagged `data-speakable`.
- **HowTo JSON-LD** added to every tool's `@graph` with 3 step entries each.
- **`dateModified` dynamic** — uses `date.today()` so all tool pages show today's date as last-reviewed.
- **sitemap `lastmod` = today** for all evergreen content (tool pages, blog index, compare, etc.) so search engines see fresh signals.

### ♿ Accessibility

- **Colour contrast** bumped to WCAG-AA across compare / blog / tool pages: `text-green-600` → `text-green-700 dark:text-green-400`, `text-red-500` → `text-red-700 dark:text-red-400`, accent badges from `bg-accent/15 text-accent` to `bg-accent/25 text-foreground border-accent/40`.
- **Sidebar headings** changed from `<h3>` to `<h2>` for correct heading order on tool pages.
- **Form labels** added with `htmlFor` / `id` pairs and `aria-label` on the YAML-to-JSON textarea and password-generator input.
- **Icon-only `<a>`** on the blog "next post" arrow gained `aria-label="Read {title}"`.

### 📱 Mobile

- **CategoryToolNav overflow** — changed from `min-w-0 max-w-full` (didn't clip on certain viewports) to `-mx-4 sm:mx-0 overflow-hidden` edge-to-edge scroll pattern.
- **Wide markdown tables** in blog posts get `display: block; overflow-x: auto` so they don't horizontal-scroll the whole page.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-12 — Converter aliases + browser-only utilities

### 🆕 New tools (20+)

**Image converter aliases** (each is its own SEO landing page hitting the unified `image-converter` backend):

JPG ↔ PNG · JPG → WebP · PNG → WebP · TIFF → JPG/PNG · BMP → JPG/PNG · GIF → JPG/PNG

**Audio / video converter aliases:**

M4A → MP3 · MP4 → MP3 · MOV → MP4 · AVI → MP4 · WebM → MP4 · MP4 → WebM

**Browser-only dev tools:**

YAML ↔ JSON · Case Converter (camelCase ↔ snake_case ↔ kebab-case ↔ PascalCase ↔ CONSTANT_CASE ↔ Title Case ↔ sentence case)

### 🔍 SEO

- Each alias gets a dedicated landing page with its own meta, TLDR, HowTo, and FAQ — surfaces in long-tail "convert X to Y" searches without duplicating backend code.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-15 — SEO / AEO / GEO sweep

### 🔍 SEO (technical)

- **robots.txt rewritten** with explicit allows for every major AI crawler: GPTBot, ChatGPT-User, OAI-SearchBot, Google-Extended, GoogleOther, PerplexityBot, Perplexity-User, ClaudeBot, anthropic-ai, Claude-Web, Claude-SearchBot, cohere-ai, Cohere-Web, CCBot, Applebot, Applebot-Extended, Meta-ExternalAgent/Fetcher, FacebookBot, Mistral-AI, YouBot, Diffbot, PetalBot. Yandex/Baidu/DDG explicitly allowed. Aggressive crawlers (Bytespider, AhrefsBot, SemrushBot, MJ12bot, DotBot) blocked.
- **Google Search Console verification fix**: SPA middleware was intercepting `/google*.html` paths and returning index.html shell instead of the 53-byte verification token. Now passes through (`/google`, `/BingSiteAuth`, `/yandex`, `/baidu_verify`).
- **Schema upgrades** (`seo_meta.py`):
  - Tool pages: `WebApplication` → `SoftwareApplication` with richer fields (`applicationSubCategory`, `browserRequirements`, `isAccessibleForFree`, `softwareVersion`, full `Offer` with `availability` + `category`)
  - Homepage: new `ItemList` schema enumerating 25 featured tools as `SoftwareApplication`s
  - Organization: enriched with `alternateName`, `foundingDate`, `license`, `description`, `ImageObject` logo, `ContactPoint`
  - Blog posts: author upgraded from `Organization` to `Person` with `sameAs` + `worksFor`; added `image`, `keywords`, `mainEntityOfPage`
  - Compare pages: `Article` → `["Article", "Review"]` with `mainEntityOfPage` + `author`

### 🎙️ AEO (Answer Engine Optimisation)

- **`speakable` JSON-LD** added to FAQ entries on tool pages, blog posts, and compare pages — gives voice assistants and featured-snippet pickers an explicit "read this aloud" target.
- **TL;DR / Key facts boxes** on every blog post (15/15). Short, snippet-optimised summary at the top of each article, with `.post-tldr` CSS class referenced by the `speakable` selector.
- **Visible author byline** with semantic `<time>` elements (E-E-A-T signal).

### 🤖 GEO (Generative Engine Optimisation)

- **`llms.txt` substantially enriched** (now ~30 KB):
  - Quick-answer comparison matrix (PrivaTools vs 7 competitors)
  - "What makes PrivaTools different (for AI citation)" section with three architectural commitments + auditable source paths
  - Auto-generated section with the 10 most-recent blog posts including their TL;DRs (parsed from `blog.ts`)
  - Inline FAQ section with 7 direct-answer Q&As
  - All competitor comparison links with one-liner verdicts

### 🔗 Internal linking

- **Auto-derived "Related articles" sidebar** on every tool page (PDF + non-PDF) from each post's `relatedTools` field — replaces a stale hand-maintained map.
- **"Tools mentioned in this article" panel** at the bottom of every blog post (15/15), with cards linking to the specific tools each post references.
- All 15 blog posts now have a `relatedTools` array — distributes link equity + gives AI engines a clean entity graph.

### 📊 By the numbers

- AI crawlers explicitly allowed: 21 (was 9)
- TL;DR boxes on blog posts: 15/15
- Blog post → tool internal links: 15 posts × avg 4 tools = ~60 new internal links
- JSON-LD types emitted: SoftwareApplication, BreadcrumbList, FAQPage, BlogPosting, Article+Review, Organization, WebSite, Person, ImageObject, ItemList, SpeakableSpecification, ContactPoint, Offer

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-15

### 🛠️ Backend

- New router `v12_tools.py` with `/api/web-optimize`, `/api/split-by-text`, `/api/pdf-to-html`, `/api/pdf-to-rtf`, `/api/view-exif`
- `pdf-to-html` uses PyMuPDF's HTML exporter; `pdf-to-rtf` does its own minimal RTF generation with Unicode escapes; `view-exif` uses PIL's getexif + GPS sub-IFD
