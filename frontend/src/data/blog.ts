    description:
      "Learn how to reduce PDF file size by up to 90% without visible quality loss. Three methods compared: online tools, desktop apps, and command-line.",
    publishedAt: "2026-03-22",
    readTime: "5 min read",
    tags: ["PDF", "Compression", "How-To"],
    body: `
<p>PDF files can balloon to enormous sizes — especially scanned documents, presentations, and forms with embedded images. Emailing a 50&nbsp;MB PDF frustrates everyone involved. The good news: you can typically cut that size by 60–90% without any visible loss in quality.</p>

<h2>Why PDF Files Get So Large</h2>
<p>PDFs store several types of data that balloon file sizes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Embedded images</strong> — The biggest culprit. A single high-resolution TIFF scan can add 10–20&nbsp;MB.</li>
  <li><strong>Embedded fonts</strong> — Full font subsets include every glyph in the typeface, adding overhead even for rarely used characters.</li>
  <li><strong>Revision history</strong> — Deleted content, old form-field states, and comment threads linger invisibly in the file structure.</li>
  <li><strong>Duplicate resources</strong> — The same image referenced on multiple pages is sometimes embedded multiple times.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lossless vs Lossy Compression</h2>
<p>There are two fundamentally different ways to shrink a PDF:</p>
<p><strong>Lossless compression</strong> removes redundant data structures without touching any content. Images remain at their original quality. Typical savings: 5–30%.</p>
<p><strong>Lossy compression</strong> resamples embedded images at a lower DPI or higher JPEG ratio. Images look nearly identical on screen and when printed at standard sizes, but pixel data is permanently altered. Typical savings: 40–90%.</p>
<p>For most everyday uses — sharing reports, uploading to portals, emailing forms — lossy compression at a "balanced" setting is the right choice. The quality difference is invisible at normal viewing sizes.</p>

<h2>Method 1: Compress PDF Online (Fastest, Free, No Software)</h2>
<p>The fastest method requires nothing but a browser:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tool/compress-pdf">PrivaTools Compress PDF</a>.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop your PDF (or click to browse).</li>
  <li>Choose a compression level: <em>Light</em>, <em>Balanced</em>, or <em>Extreme</em>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Compress</strong> and download the result instantly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your file is processed and immediately deleted after download — it is never stored, indexed, or shared. If file privacy matters (medical records, legal documents, financials), this matters.</p>

<h2>Method 2: Adobe Acrobat (Desktop, Paid)</h2>
<p>Acrobat Pro's <em>Reduce File Size</em> and <em>PDF Optimizer</em> tools give granular control — you can independently dial down image DPI, remove embedded fonts, strip metadata, and prune revision history. Results are excellent but require an Acrobat Pro subscription (~$23/month).</p>
<p>For occasional compression needs, this is overkill. Use an online tool instead.</p>

<h2>Method 3: Ghostscript (Command-Line, Free, Batch)</h2>
<p>For developers or power users compressing many files:</p>
<pre><code>gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 \
   -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook \
   -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH \
   -sOutputFile=output.pdf input.pdf</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-dPDFSETTINGS</code> flag controls quality: <code>/screen</code> (smallest), <code>/ebook</code> (balanced), <code>/printer</code> (high quality), <code>/prepress</code> (maximum quality).</p>

<h2>Tips to Get Maximum Compression</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Strip metadata first</strong> — Remove author names, GPS data, and creation timestamps with <a href="/tool/strip-metadata">Strip PDF Metadata</a> before compressing.</li>
  <li><strong>Flatten filled forms</strong> — Interactive fields carry overhead. <a href="/tool/flatten-pdf">Flatten</a> the PDF before compressing if the form is already completed.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove blank pages</strong> — Scanned documents often include blank separators. <a href="/tool/remove-blank-pages">Delete them</a> first.</li>
  <li><strong>Don't compress twice</strong> — Running a compressed PDF through compression again yields minimal savings and can degrade quality further.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Realistic Size Expectations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scanned documents (image PDFs)</strong>: 60–90% reduction with Balanced or Extreme.</li>
  <li><strong>PDFs with embedded JPEG photos</strong>: 20–50% reduction with Balanced.</li>
  <li><strong>Text-only PDFs</strong>: 5–20% reduction — there's little image data to compress.</li>
  <li><strong>Already-compressed PDFs</strong>: Minimal savings; may even increase size slightly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>For most documents, the <strong>Balanced</strong> preset in a good PDF compressor will produce a file that looks identical to the original at all standard viewing sizes, at 40–70% smaller size. Start there — only reach for Extreme compression if file size is more critical than occasional print fidelity.</p>

    description:
      "Step-by-step guide to combining multiple PDF files online for free. Drag, drop, reorder, and merge — no software, no account, no watermarks.",

    tags: ["PDF", "Merge", "How-To"],
    body: `
<p>Whether you're assembling a report from multiple chapters, combining signed contract pages, or packaging several scanned receipts into one file — merging PDFs is one of the most common file tasks. Here's how to do it online for free, without downloading anything.</p>

<h2>When You Need to Merge PDFs</h2>
<p>Common reasons people merge PDF files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Combining chapters or sections written separately into one document</li>
  <li>Assembling a job application (resume, cover letter, portfolio) as a single PDF</li>
  <li>Collating multiple invoices or receipts for expense reporting</li>
  <li>Combining front-side and back-side duplex scans in the correct order</li>
  <li>Packaging signed contract pages with attachments</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Merge PDFs Online — Step by Step</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tool/merge-pdf">PrivaTools Merge PDF</a> in your browser.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add Files</strong> or drag and drop multiple PDFs into the upload zone. You can add as many files as you need.</li>
  <li><strong>Reorder the files</strong> by dragging them into the desired sequence. The top file will be the first pages of the merged document.</li>
  <li>Optionally preview individual file thumbnails to verify page order before merging.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Merge PDF</strong>. The combined file downloads to your device within seconds.</li>
</ol>
<p>No account, no email, no watermark. The merged PDF is yours entirely — PrivaTools does not retain any copy of your files.</p>

<h2>Page-Level Control</h2>
<p>If you need to merge specific pages rather than entire files, use <a href="/tool/extract-pages">Extract Pages</a> to pull the pages you want from each source PDF first, then merge the extracts. This gives you precise control over exactly which content ends up in the final document.</p>

<h2>Merging Scanned Documents (Duplex Order)</h2>
<p>Scanners that do single-sided scanning produce two files from a double-sided document: all the odd pages in one scan, all the even pages in another — often in reverse order. The <a href="/tool/alternate-mix">Alternate Mix</a> tool interleaves pages from two PDFs in alternating fashion, reconstructing the correct double-sided page order automatically.</p>

<h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
<p>Most free online PDF mergers upload your files to their servers, process them, and store them for a period afterward (sometimes 1–24 hours). If your PDFs contain sensitive content — legal contracts, financial statements, medical records — this matters.</p>
<p>PrivaTools processes files through a FastAPI backend and deletes them immediately after your download. The source code is open and auditable at <a href="https://github.com/taiyeba-dg/privatools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>. If you want total certainty, you can self-host the entire stack with Docker.</p>

<h2>What About File Size Limits?</h2>
<p>PrivaTools supports uploads up to 500&nbsp;MB per file — far more generous than most free tools. Even large scan archives and high-resolution documents can be merged directly without pre-compression.</p>

<h2>Alternatives to Online Merging</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>macOS Preview</strong> — Drag thumbnails between open PDFs in the sidebar. Built-in, no software needed.</li>
  <li><strong>pdftk (command-line)</strong> — <code>pdftk file1.pdf file2.pdf cat output merged.pdf</code>. Fast for batch scripts.</li>
  <li><strong>Adobe Acrobat</strong> — Reliable but requires a paid subscription.</li>
</ul>
<p>For quick, occasional merges without installing anything, an online tool is the fastest option.</p>

    title: "Best Free PDF Tools in 2026: Honest Comparison",
    description:
      "We tested 8 free PDF tool suites in 2026. Honest verdict on which are truly free, which have hidden limits, and which respect your privacy.",
    publishedAt: "2026-03-22",
    readTime: "8 min read",
    tags: ["PDF", "Comparison", "Review"],
    body: `
<p>Searching for "free PDF tools" returns hundreds of options — but many aren't truly free. Some limit you to 2 tasks per day. Others add watermarks unless you pay. A few quietly upload your documents to their servers and retain them indefinitely. This guide cuts through the noise.</p>

<h2>Our Testing Criteria</h2>
<p>We evaluated each tool on four dimensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Actually free?</strong> No task limits, no file size caps, no paywalled essentials.</li>
  <li><strong>No account required?</strong> You shouldn't need to hand over your email to compress a PDF.</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy?</strong> Where do files go? How long are they retained? Is the code auditable?</li>
  <li><strong>Tool breadth?</strong> How many operations are covered? PDF-only vs multi-format?</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. PrivaTools — Best Overall for Privacy + Tool Count</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> Yes, 100% · <strong>Account required:</strong> No · <strong>Tools:</strong> 107 (PDF, Image, Video, Developer)</p>
<p>PrivaTools is open source (MIT license), self-hostable, and covers the most tool categories of any free suite tested. It handles PDF operations, image processing, video tools, and developer utilities — all in one place. Files are processed on the server and immediately deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> No task limits, no ads, no watermarks, open-source and auditable. Covers tools that most PDF suites don't touch (video compression, developer utilities, archive tools).</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Server-side processing (not fully client-side). Newer service with a smaller community than established alternatives.</p>

<h2>2. iLovePDF — Most Popular, but Limited</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> Limited · <strong>Account required:</strong> No · <strong>Tools:</strong> ~25 (PDF only)</p>
<p>iLovePDF is the most trafficked free PDF tool on the internet. The free tier allows basic operations without an account, but file sizes are capped at 25&nbsp;MB and the experience pushes aggressively toward premium upgrades. Files are uploaded to their servers and retained for a period after download.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Good for quick, low-stakes operations. Not suitable for sensitive documents.</p>

<h2>3. Smallpdf — Quality UX, Aggressive Limits</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> 2 tasks/day · <strong>Account required:</strong> No · <strong>Tools:</strong> ~21 (PDF only)</p>
<p>Smallpdf is polished, fast, and handles most common PDF tasks. The 2-tasks-per-day free limit is the most commonly complained-about restriction in the PDF tool space. If you need to compress three files in one afternoon, you'll hit the wall.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Best UX in the free tier. Worst limit. Use sparingly.</p>

<h2>4. PDF24 — Genuinely Free, But Not Open Source</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> Yes · <strong>Account required:</strong> No · <strong>Tools:</strong> ~45 (PDF + basic image)</p>
<p>PDF24 is the closest competitor to PrivaTools in terms of being genuinely free with no task limits. It covers a wide range of PDF operations, has a Windows desktop app, and doesn't require an account. The catch: it's not open source, so you can't audit what happens to your files, and it's ad-supported.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> A solid choice if you need a free tool and privacy isn't a concern.</p>

<h2>5. Adobe Acrobat Online — Industry Standard, Expensive</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> Very limited · <strong>Account required:</strong> Yes (Adobe ID) · <strong>Tools:</strong> ~15 free</p>
<p>Adobe's free online tier lets you do a handful of basic conversions per month, but the real tools (editing, signing, OCR) require a subscription. An Adobe ID is mandatory. Files are processed in the Adobe cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Only worth it if you already have an Acrobat subscription. Otherwise, overkill.</p>

<h2>6. Sejda — Clean UI, Strict Hourly Limits</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> 3 tasks/hour, 50&nbsp;MB limit · <strong>Account required:</strong> No · <strong>Tools:</strong> ~25 (PDF only)</p>
<p>Sejda has a clean, minimalist interface and genuinely good tools — especially its PDF editor. The 3-tasks-per-hour limit is more generous than Smallpdf's daily cap but still frustrating for heavy users. Files are deleted from Sejda's servers within 2 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Good for occasional PDF editing. Better privacy policy than most alternatives.</p>

<h2>7. Stirling PDF — Best for Self-Hosting</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> Yes (self-hosted) · <strong>Account required:</strong> No · <strong>Tools:</strong> ~50 (PDF only)</p>
<p>Stirling PDF is an open-source (GPL-3.0) PDF tool suite that you deploy yourself with Docker. If you want zero data leaving your network, this is the strongest option — but it requires technical knowledge to set up.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Best for privacy-conscious users with a home server or VPS. Not suitable for non-technical users.</p>

<h2>8. Foxit PDF — Business Grade, Fully Paid</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> No (trial only) · <strong>Account required:</strong> Yes · <strong>Tools:</strong> PDF suite</p>
<p>Foxit is a legitimate Adobe Acrobat alternative for enterprise use, with strong editing and e-signature capabilities. There is no meaningful free tier — the trial converts files with watermarks.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Consider only for business use where you need desktop-grade PDF editing with support contracts.</p>

<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p>If you want a tool that is genuinely free (no task limits, no upsells), handles more than just PDFs, and treats your files with respect: <a href="/">PrivaTools</a> is the answer. If you need a self-hosted option and have the technical skills: Stirling PDF. If you just need to compress one file and don't care about privacy: PDF24 works fine.</p>
<p>Avoid Smallpdf's 2-task limit for anything resembling regular use, and don't upload sensitive documents to iLovePDF or Adobe without reading their data retention policies.</p>

    title: "How to Remove a Password from a PDF",
    description:
      "Three ways to remove or bypass a PDF password you own — online tool, Adobe Acrobat, and command-line — explained step by step.",
    publishedAt: "2026-03-22",
    readTime: "4 min read",
    tags: ["PDF", "Security", "How-To"],
    body: `
<p>PDF passwords come in two varieties, and understanding which type you're dealing with determines which removal method works.</p>

<h2>Two Types of PDF Passwords</h2>
<p><strong>Open password (user password)</strong> — Required to open and view the document. Without this password, the file appears as scrambled, unreadable data. This is true encryption.</p>
<p><strong>Permissions password (owner password)</strong> — Does not prevent opening the file, but restricts operations: printing, copying text, editing, or annotating. Many PDF tools can remove this type of restriction without knowing the password, because the file content itself isn't encrypted — only the permission flags are set.</p>
<p>The methods below apply to removing passwords from PDFs <strong>you legally own</strong>. Attempting to decrypt PDFs you don't have rights to is illegal in most jurisdictions.</p>

<h2>Method 1: Remove Password Online (Easiest)</h2>
<p>For PDFs where you know the open password:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tool/unlock-pdf">PrivaTools Unlock PDF</a>.</li>
  <li>Upload your password-protected PDF.</li>
  <li>Enter the correct password when prompted.</li>
  <li>Download the unlocked PDF — password-free, fully accessible.</li>
</ol>
<p>This works for both open passwords (when you provide the correct one) and permissions passwords (restrictions are lifted). Your file is deleted immediately after download.</p>

<h2>Method 2: Adobe Acrobat (Desktop)</h2>
<p>If you have Acrobat Pro:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the PDF in Acrobat. Enter the password if prompted.</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>Tools → Protect → Security → Remove Security</strong>.</li>
  <li>If prompted for the permissions password, enter it. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
  <li>Save the file. The password is removed from the saved copy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Acrobat also shows exactly which permissions are restricted and allows you to modify them individually.</p>

<h2>Method 3: Print to PDF (Works for Open Passwords You Know)</h2>
<p>A simple workaround available on any operating system:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the PDF in any viewer (enter the password).</li>
  <li>Use <strong>File → Print</strong> and select <strong>"Save as PDF"</strong> (macOS) or <strong>"Microsoft Print to PDF"</strong> (Windows) as the printer.</li>
  <li>Save the new PDF. It will be a copy without the password.</li>
</ol>
<p>Caveat: this re-renders the PDF as a new document. Complex layouts, hyperlinks, form fields, bookmarks, and exact font rendering may not be preserved. Use this only when you need the content, not the exact file structure.</p>

<h2>What If You Forgot the Password?</h2>
<p>If you've genuinely forgotten the password to a PDF you own, options are limited:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check if the original sender can resend an unlocked version.</li>
  <li>Check your password manager or saved passwords.</li>
  <li>For permissions-only passwords (no open password), online tools like PrivaTools can often remove the restrictions without needing the password, since the file content is technically accessible.</li>
  <li>True open-password encryption (AES-128/256) cannot be broken with any online tool. Forensic password recovery software exists but is slow and not guaranteed for strong passwords.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Check What Kind of Password a PDF Has</h2>
<p>Try opening the PDF without a password:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If it opens but printing/copying is greyed out → it has a <strong>permissions password only</strong>. You can remove restrictions without the password using <a href="/tool/unlock-pdf">Unlock PDF</a>.</li>
  <li>If it won't open at all and demands a password → it has an <strong>open password</strong>. You must know the correct password to decrypt it.</li>
</ul>

      "5 ways to convert .docx files to PDF without Microsoft Office — online tools, Google Docs, LibreOffice — plus which preserves formatting best.",
    publishedAt: "2026-03-22",
    readTime: "5 min read",
    tags: ["PDF", "Convert", "How-To"],
    body: `
<p>Converting a Word document to PDF is one of the most common file tasks — and one of the easiest to do for free. Here are five methods, from fastest to most control, with honest notes on which preserves formatting best.</p>

<h2>Why Convert Word to PDF?</h2>
<p>PDF is the universally readable format — it looks the same on every device, operating system, and screen size, regardless of whether the recipient has Microsoft Office installed. Sending a .docx file is risky: fonts may substitute, spacing may shift, and the layout you spent hours perfecting can look different on the other end. PDF locks the presentation.</p>

<h2>Method 1: PrivaTools Word to PDF (Online, No Software)</h2>
<p>The fastest option if you don't have Office installed:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tool/word-to-pdf">PrivaTools Word to PDF</a>.</li>
  <li>Upload your .docx file (up to 100&nbsp;MB).</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Convert</strong> and download the PDF.</li>
</ol>
<p>Conversion uses LibreOffice under the hood, which handles most formatting correctly — headings, bold/italic, images, tables, and standard paragraph styles. Your file is deleted immediately after conversion.</p>
<p><strong>Formatting fidelity:</strong> Excellent for standard documents. Complex custom styles, tracked changes, or embedded macros may not survive perfectly.</p>

<h2>Method 2: Google Docs (Free, Browser-Based)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Upload the .docx to Google Drive.</li>
  <li>Open it with Google Docs (right-click → Open with → Google Docs).</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>File → Download → PDF Document (.pdf)</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Formatting fidelity:</strong> Good for simple documents. Google Docs re-renders the document in its own engine, which can shift spacing on complex layouts. Headers/footers, custom page sizes, and intricate tables sometimes look different.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy note:</strong> Your document is uploaded to and processed by Google's servers. It will remain in your Google Drive unless you delete it.</p>

<h2>Method 3: Microsoft Word (Save as PDF)</h2>
<p>If you have Microsoft Word (desktop or Microsoft 365):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open your document in Word.</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>File → Save As → PDF</strong> (or <strong>File → Export → Create PDF/XPS</strong>).</li>
  <li>Choose whether to optimize for <em>Standard</em> (print quality) or <em>Minimum size</em> (web).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Formatting fidelity:</strong> Best. Word renders its own format natively, preserving every typographic detail exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Requires a Microsoft 365 subscription or perpetual license.</p>

<h2>Method 4: LibreOffice (Free Desktop App)</h2>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download and install LibreOffice</a> (free, open source).</li>
  <li>Open your .docx in LibreOffice Writer.</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>File → Export As → Export as PDF</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Formatting fidelity:</strong> Very good for standard documents. Matches what PrivaTools produces (same rendering engine). Better than Google Docs for complex layouts.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Users who need offline conversion without a subscription.</p>

<h2>Method 5: macOS Print to PDF (Built-In)</h2>
<p>Every Mac has a built-in PDF printer — no software needed:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the .docx in any application (even Preview can open simple Word files).</li>
  <li>Press <strong>Cmd + P</strong> to open the Print dialog.</li>
  <li>Click the PDF dropdown in the bottom-left → <strong>Save as PDF</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Formatting fidelity:</strong> Depends on the application you used to open the file. If opened in Pages or Preview rather than Word, formatting can shift significantly.</p>

<h2>Which Method Preserves Formatting Best?</h2>

    <tr><td>Google Docs</td><td>Good</td><td>Free</td><td>Stored in Google Drive</td></tr>
    <tr><td>macOS Print to PDF</td><td>Varies</td><td>Free</td><td>Local</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>What About .doc Files (Older Word Format)?</h2>
<p>All five methods above also work with the older .doc format, though formatting fidelity may be slightly lower due to the format's age and quirks. If possible, re-save .doc files as .docx before converting.</p>

<p>Need to add a sentence to a contract, fix a typo on a form, or annotate a report? Editing a PDF used to require expensive desktop software. Today you can do it in a browser for free — no account, no download, no watermark.</p>

<h2>What "Edit PDF" Actually Means</h2>
<p>PDF editing covers a wide range of operations, and not all tools handle all of them:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Text annotation</strong> — Adding new text boxes, sticky notes, or comments on top of existing content. Nearly every tool supports this.</li>
  <li><strong>Form filling</strong> — Filling in interactive form fields (text boxes, checkboxes, dropdowns). Requires the PDF to have form fields defined.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct text editing</strong> — Modifying existing text in the PDF (changing words, fixing typos). This is harder because PDFs store text as positioned character runs, not editable paragraphs. Only a few tools do this well.</li>
  <li><strong>Image editing</strong> — Adding, replacing, or removing images within the PDF.</li>
  <li><strong>Page manipulation</strong> — Reordering, deleting, rotating, or adding pages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method 1: PrivaTools Edit PDF (Free, No Sign-Up)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tool/edit-pdf">PrivaTools Edit PDF</a>.</li>
  <li>Upload your PDF (up to 100&nbsp;MB).</li>
  <li>Use the toolbar to add text boxes, highlights, shapes, or freehand drawings on any page.</li>
  <li>Click Save to download the edited PDF with all changes flattened into the document.</li>
</ol>
<p>Annotations are permanently embedded — they'll appear in any PDF reader. Your file is deleted from the server within minutes.</p>

<h2>Method 2: PrivaTools Specialized Tools</h2>
<p>For specific editing tasks, dedicated tools often work better than a general editor:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/tool/sign-pdf">Sign PDF</a> — Draw, type, or upload a signature image</li>
  <li><a href="/tool/annotate-pdf">Annotate PDF</a> — Highlights, underlines, strikethrough, sticky notes</li>
  <li><a href="/tool/fill-form">Fill PDF Form</a> — Fill interactive form fields</li>
  <li><a href="/tool/watermark">Watermark PDF</a> — Add text or image watermarks</li>
  <li><a href="/tool/redact-pdf">Redact PDF</a> — Permanently black out sensitive information</li>
  <li><a href="/tool/whiteout-pdf">White-Out PDF</a> — Cover content with white rectangles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method 3: Google Docs (Free, Account Required)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Upload the PDF to Google Drive.</li>
  <li>Right-click → Open with → Google Docs.</li>
  <li>Edit the text directly, then download as PDF.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> Google Docs converts the PDF to its own format, which frequently breaks formatting — columns collapse, images shift, fonts change. This works for simple text-only documents but is unreliable for anything with layout complexity.</p>

<h2>Method 4: macOS Preview (Free, Built-In)</h2>
<p>Preview on macOS lets you add text, shapes, signatures, and highlights to PDFs. It cannot edit existing text, but it handles annotations well. No software installation needed.</p>

<h2>Method 5: Adobe Acrobat Online (Limited Free)</h2>
<p>Adobe allows a few free operations per month with an Adobe ID. The editing tools are good but gated behind a subscription for regular use. Files are processed in Adobe's cloud.</p>

<h2>Can You Edit Text Directly in a PDF?</h2>
<p>True text editing (changing existing words) is technically possible but has limitations. PDFs don't store text as you'd expect — each character is individually positioned on the page. When you change a word, the surrounding text doesn't reflow automatically. For significant text changes, it's often better to convert the PDF back to Word with <a href="/tool/pdf-to-word">PDF to Word</a>, make your edits, and convert back with <a href="/tool/word-to-pdf">Word to PDF</a>.</p>

<h2>Privacy Matters When Editing Sensitive Documents</h2>
<p>Contracts, tax forms, medical records, legal filings — these are exactly the types of PDFs people need to edit, and exactly the types you shouldn't upload to random websites. PrivaTools processes files on the server and deletes them within minutes. The code is <a href="https://github.com/taiyeba-dg/privatools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source</a> — you can verify this yourself or self-host the entire stack.</p>

    description:
      "Three ways to split PDF files for free: by page range, by file size, and by bookmarks. No software needed, no sign-up.",

    tags: ["PDF", "Split", "How-To"],
    body: `
<p>Whether you need to extract a few pages from a long report, break a document into email-friendly chunks, or separate chapters from a textbook — splitting a PDF is straightforward with the right tool.</p>

<h2>Three Ways to Split a PDF</h2>
<p>Different situations call for different splitting methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>By page range</strong> — "Give me pages 1-5 as one file and pages 6-20 as another." The most common use case.</li>
  <li><strong>By file size</strong> — "Break this 80&nbsp;MB scan into chunks under 10&nbsp;MB so I can email them." Useful for attachments.</li>
  <li><strong>By bookmarks</strong> — "Split this textbook into one PDF per chapter." Requires the PDF to have bookmarks defined.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method 1: Split by Page Range (Most Common)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tool/split-pdf">PrivaTools Split PDF</a>.</li>
  <li>Upload your PDF (up to 100&nbsp;MB).</li>
  <li>Choose your split mode:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fixed interval</strong> — Split every N pages (e.g., every 5 pages creates separate PDFs).</li>
      <li><strong>Custom ranges</strong> — Specify exact page numbers (e.g., "1-3, 7-10, 15-20").</li>
      <li><strong>Extract every page</strong> — One PDF per page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click Split. The resulting files are packaged in a ZIP for download.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Method 2: Split by File Size</h2>
<p>When email size limits are the problem rather than page counts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tool/split-by-size">PrivaTools Split by Size</a>.</li>
  <li>Upload the PDF.</li>
  <li>Set the maximum file size per chunk (e.g., 10&nbsp;MB).</li>
  <li>The tool splits at page boundaries, keeping each part under your target size.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is particularly useful for large scanned documents that need to be emailed or uploaded to portals with size restrictions.</p>

<h2>Method 3: Split by Bookmarks / Chapters</h2>
<p>For structured documents like textbooks, manuals, or reports with a table of contents:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tool/split-by-bookmarks">PrivaTools Split by Bookmarks</a>.</li>
  <li>Upload the PDF. The tool detects bookmark entries automatically.</li>
  <li>Choose the bookmark level to split at (top-level bookmarks = chapters, second-level = sections).</li>
  <li>Each section becomes its own PDF file.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Extract Just a Few Pages</h2>
<p>If you only need specific pages rather than splitting the entire document, <a href="/tool/extract-pages">Extract Pages</a> is more precise. Select individual pages or ranges and get a new PDF containing only those pages.</p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>macOS Preview</strong> — Drag pages from the sidebar to the desktop to create individual page PDFs. Manual but requires no tools.</li>
  <li><strong>pdftk (command-line)</strong> — <code>pdftk input.pdf cat 1-5 output pages1-5.pdf</code>. Excellent for scripting batch splits.</li>
  <li><strong>Adobe Acrobat</strong> — Full-featured splitting with preview, but requires a paid subscription.</li>
</ul>

    title: "How to Redact Sensitive Information from PDFs — Free Guide",
    description:
      "Learn how to permanently black out names, SSNs, addresses, and confidential text in PDFs. Understand why covering text with black boxes isn't enough.",
    publishedAt: "2026-03-29",
    readTime: "5 min read",
    tags: ["PDF", "Security", "Redaction", "How-To"],
    body: `
<p>PDF redaction permanently removes sensitive information from a document — names, Social Security numbers, financial data, addresses, or any confidential text. But there's a critical distinction between <em>real</em> redaction and simply drawing a black box over text.</p>

<h2>Why Black Boxes Aren't Enough</h2>
<p>A common mistake: people draw a black rectangle over sensitive text using a PDF editor and think it's hidden. It's not. The text underneath is still in the PDF file — anyone can select it, copy-paste it, or use a text extraction tool to read it. This has caused real data breaches in legal filings, government documents, and corporate reports.</p>
<p><strong>Real redaction</strong> permanently destroys the underlying text data. After proper redaction, the original content cannot be recovered — even by editing the PDF's raw source code.</p>

<h2>How to Redact a PDF Properly</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tool/redact-pdf">PrivaTools Redact PDF</a>.</li>
  <li>Upload the document containing sensitive information.</li>
  <li>Draw rectangles over the text, images, or regions you want to permanently remove. You can also search for a specific word or phrase to auto-highlight all occurrences across every page.</li>
  <li>Preview the redactions to verify you've covered everything before committing.</li>
  <li>Click Redact. The underlying content is permanently destroyed and replaced with black boxes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Redaction is irreversible. Once applied, the original text cannot be recovered. Always keep an unredacted backup copy of the original document.</p>

<h2>What Gets Removed During Redaction?</h2>
<p>Proper redaction removes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The visible text and images under the redaction box</li>
  <li>The underlying text data (not just the visual layer)</li>
  <li>Any associated metadata linked to the redacted content</li>
</ul>
<p>For maximum security, combine redaction with <a href="/tool/sanitize-pdf">Sanitize PDF</a> to also remove hidden data, JavaScript, embedded files, and metadata layers.</p>

<h2>Common Redaction Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Using a black highlight instead of redaction</strong> — Highlights change the background color but don't remove the text data.</li>
  <li><strong>Using white-out</strong> — White rectangles hide text visually but the data is still selectable and extractable.</li>
  <li><strong>Forgetting headers and footers</strong> — Document names, case numbers, and dates often appear in headers/footers on every page.</li>
  <li><strong>Ignoring metadata</strong> — The document title, author name, and revision history may contain the same information you're redacting from the body. Use <a href="/tool/strip-metadata">Strip Metadata</a> after redacting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When You Need Redaction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) responses</li>
  <li>Legal discovery — removing privileged information before producing documents</li>
  <li>HR documents — removing SSNs, salaries, or personal details before sharing</li>
  <li>Medical records — HIPAA compliance when sharing patient documents</li>
  <li>Financial documents — removing account numbers before forwarding</li>
</ul>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Adobe Acrobat Pro</strong> — Has a dedicated Redact tool with search-and-redact. Paid subscription required.</li>
  <li><strong>PDF-XChange Editor</strong> — Windows-only, has redaction in the paid version.</li>
  <li><strong>Command-line (qpdf + mutool)</strong> — Technical but scriptable for batch redaction workflows.</li>
</ul>

    description:
      "We tested 7 free online PDF editors in 2026. Here's which ones are truly free, which add watermarks, and which respect your privacy.",
    publishedAt: "2026-03-29",
    readTime: "7 min read",
    tags: ["PDF", "Editor", "Comparison", "Review"],
    body: `
<p>Every online PDF editor claims to be free. Most aren't — at least not in any meaningful way. After testing seven popular options, here's what we found.</p>

<h2>What We Tested</h2>
<p>We uploaded the same 15-page document (a mix of text, images, tables, and form fields) to each editor and tested: adding text, adding a signature, highlighting, filling forms, and re-downloading. We checked for watermarks, file size limits, task limits, account requirements, and how files are handled after download.</p>

<h2>1. PrivaTools — Best for Privacy + No Limits</h2>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free · <strong>Account:</strong> Not required · <strong>Watermarks:</strong> None · <strong>File limit:</strong> 500 MB</p>
<p><a href="/tool/edit-pdf">PrivaTools Edit PDF</a> lets you add text, highlights, shapes, and signatures to any PDF. It also offers 76 other PDF tools — from <a href="/tool/merge-pdf">merging</a> to <a href="/tool/ocr-pdf">OCR</a> to <a href="/tool/redact-pdf">redaction</a> — all free, all without accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy:</strong> Files are processed on the server and deleted within minutes. The source code is open and auditable on GitHub. You can self-host the entire stack with Docker for complete control.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Users who need frequent PDF editing without limits and care about where their files go.</p>

<h2>2. Sejda — Best General-Purpose Editor</h2>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free (3 tasks/hour) · <strong>Account:</strong> Not required · <strong>Watermarks:</strong> None · <strong>File limit:</strong> 50 MB</p>
<p>Sejda's online editor is arguably the most full-featured free option for direct text editing — you can click on existing text and modify it, not just add annotations. The 3-task-per-hour limit is the main downside.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Occasional editing where you need to modify existing text rather than just annotate.</p>

<h2>3. PDF24 — Most Generous Free Tier</h2>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free · <strong>Account:</strong> Not required · <strong>Watermarks:</strong> None · <strong>File limit:</strong> Generous</p>
<p>PDF24 is genuinely free with no task limits. The editor is functional but basic — it handles annotations, form filling, and simple text addition. Not open source, and files are uploaded to their servers.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Users who need a no-limits free tool and don't prioritize privacy.</p>

<h2>4. PDFescape — Simple but Dated</h2>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free (10 MB, 100 pages) · <strong>Account:</strong> Not required · <strong>Watermarks:</strong> None</p>
<p>PDFescape works for basic editing — adding text, forms, annotations. The interface feels outdated compared to modern alternatives, and the 10 MB file limit is restrictive. It was one of the first free online PDF editors and still gets traffic from brand recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Quick, simple edits on small documents.</p>

<h2>5. Smallpdf — Polished but Restrictive</h2>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free (2 tasks/day) · <strong>Account:</strong> Not required · <strong>Watermarks:</strong> None on free</p>
<p>Smallpdf's editor is clean and well-designed. The 2-task daily limit makes it impractical for regular use. Files are uploaded to Smallpdf's servers and retained for a period.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> A one-off edit when you need a quick, polished experience.</p>

<h2>6. iLovePDF — Popular but Limited</h2>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free (limited) · <strong>Account:</strong> Optional · <strong>Watermarks:</strong> On some exports</p>
<p>iLovePDF's editor handles basic annotations. Free users face file size limits (25 MB), and the experience pushes aggressively toward premium. Files are uploaded to and retained on their servers.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Light use when other options aren't available.</p>

<h2>7. Adobe Acrobat Online — Best Features, Worst Free Tier</h2>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Very limited free · <strong>Account:</strong> Required (Adobe ID) · <strong>Watermarks:</strong> None</p>
<p>Adobe's online tools are technically excellent but gated behind an account and a limited free tier. Meaningful editing requires a subscription (~$23/month). Files go through Adobe's cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Users who already have an Adobe subscription.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>For unrestricted free editing with privacy: <a href="/tool/edit-pdf">PrivaTools</a>. For the best direct text editing (with limits): Sejda. For no-limits without caring about privacy: PDF24. Everything else either costs money, limits you to a handful of tasks, or both.</p>

    description:
      "How AI-powered PDF summarizers work, why running them in the browser matters, and a step-by-step walkthrough of summarizing a 100-page PDF without any upload — entirely on your device.",
    publishedAt: "2026-05-15",
    readTime: "9 min read",
    author: "PrivaTools Team",
    tags: ["AI", "PDF", "Privacy", "How-To"],
    body: `
<p>Long PDFs are everywhere — research papers, contracts, legal filings, technical docs, financial reports. Reading them end-to-end is rarely the highest-value use of your time. AI summarization promises to give you the gist in seconds. But there's a catch most people miss: <strong>uploading a PDF to a cloud AI service hands the entire document to that service</strong>, often forever.</p>

<p>This guide explains how AI PDF summarization actually works, why browser-side summarization changes the privacy equation, and how to summarize a long PDF — even a 100-page one — without any data leaving your computer.</p>

<h2>What Is an AI PDF Summarizer?</h2>
<p>An AI PDF summarizer takes the text content of a PDF and produces a shorter version that preserves the key information. Modern summarizers fall into two architectures:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Extractive</strong>: pulls out the most "important" sentences from the source verbatim. Fast, factually faithful, but choppy.</li>
  <li><strong>Abstractive</strong>: generates new sentences that paraphrase the source. Reads more naturally, but can hallucinate details that aren't in the original.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best 2026 summarizers are abstractive transformers — variants of BART, T5, or distilled GPT-style models — that have been fine-tuned on news, scientific papers, and dialog corpora.</p>

<h2>Why Browser-Side Summarization Matters</h2>
<p>Most "free" AI PDF summarizers operate the same way under the hood:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You upload the PDF to their servers.</li>
  <li>The text is extracted and run through a model in their data center.</li>
  <li>The summary is shown to you.</li>
  <li>Your PDF is retained — sometimes "for 24 hours", sometimes indefinitely, sometimes used to train future models.</li>
</ol>
<p>Read the privacy policies. Phrases like "we may use your content to improve our services" almost always mean your document is now training data.</p>
<p>For most public documents that doesn't matter. For confidential ones — medical records, legal drafts, internal strategy memos, financial statements — it absolutely does.</p>
<p>Browser-side summarization works differently:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The model itself is downloaded into your browser the first time you visit (usually 200–500 MB, cached in IndexedDB).</li>
  <li>The PDF text is extracted in JavaScript using pdf.js.</li>
  <li>The transformer runs in WebAssembly inside your browser tab.</li>
  <li>The summary is generated locally; no network calls leave your machine after the model loads.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can verify this by opening DevTools → Network and watching: after the model is cached, no requests fire while summarization runs.</p>

<h2>How It Works Technically: distilbart in the Browser</h2>
<p>PrivaTools' <a href="/tool/summarize-pdf">Summarize PDF</a> tool uses Hugging Face's <code>distilbart-cnn-12-6</code> model, a distilled version of BART trained on the CNN/DailyMail summarization dataset. It runs via the <code>@huggingface/transformers</code> JavaScript SDK, which compiles the model graph to WebAssembly.</p>
<p>The pipeline for a 100-page PDF roughly looks like:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Extract text page-by-page</strong> with pdf.js. Output: ~80,000–150,000 characters.</li>
  <li><strong>Chunk at sentence boundaries</strong> to fit the model's 1024-token context window. Output: 80–150 chunks.</li>
  <li><strong>Summarize each chunk</strong> independently (~2–4 seconds per chunk on a modern laptop).</li>
  <li><strong>Stitch the chunk summaries together</strong>. For very long docs, run a <em>second pass</em> over the joined summaries to produce a coherent overview.</li>
</ol>
<p>Total time on a 2026 laptop: ~3–6 minutes for a 100-page PDF, almost entirely CPU-bound. On a phone, expect 10–20 minutes — slow but doable.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step: Summarize a PDF Privately</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open the <a href="/tool/summarize-pdf">Summarize PDF tool</a>.</li>
  <li>Drag your PDF into the upload area (or click to browse).</li>
  <li>Wait for the model to download on first use (one-time, ~250 MB).</li>
  <li>Choose a summary length — short, medium, or long.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Summarize</strong> and watch progress per chunk.</li>
  <li>Copy the summary or download it as a text file.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're privacy-paranoid (good!), <kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd> → "Open file" while DevTools is on the Network tab. Drop your PDF, summarize, and confirm zero requests leave your machine.</p>

<h2>When NOT to Use Browser-Side Summarization</h2>
<p>Local summarization has tradeoffs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>You're stuck with smaller models.</strong> distilbart is a fraction the size of GPT-4 or Claude — quality is good but not best-in-class.</li>
  <li><strong>First-load is slow.</strong> The model download (~250 MB) takes 30–90s on a typical connection. After caching, subsequent uses are instant.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile browsers struggle</strong> with very long documents. Stick to desktop for 50+ page PDFs.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-English content</strong> needs different models. distilbart-cnn is English-only.</li>
</ul>
<p>If quality matters more than privacy and the document is non-sensitive, cloud services like Claude or GPT-4 still beat browser-side models. But for anything you wouldn't paste into a stranger's terminal: keep it local.</p>

<h2>Browser AI Beyond Summarization</h2>
<p>The same architecture powers <a href="/tool/smart-redact">Smart Redact</a>: a BERT-based named-entity recognition model scans for names, emails, phone numbers, and SSNs, then proposes redactions you can accept or reject. The model never sees the cloud.</p>
<p>Expect 2026 to bring more of this — translation, classification, semantic search — all running in 200–500 MB browser-cached models. The privacy story keeps getting better.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Is browser-side AI as accurate as ChatGPT or Claude?</h3>
<p>Not yet, no. Cloud-hosted frontier models are 50–100x larger and produce better summaries on average. But distilbart is good enough for most professional use — and the privacy guarantee is something cloud services can't offer.</p>

<h3>Does my data really stay private?</h3>
<p>Yes — for browser-side tools like PrivaTools' summarizer. The model loads once via a CDN; after that, all inference runs in WebAssembly inside your tab. Verify with DevTools → Network. No backend processes the file.</p>

<h3>Can I summarize an encrypted PDF?</h3>
<p>Not directly. First <a href="/tool/unlock-pdf">unlock the PDF</a> with the password, then summarize.</p>

<h3>How long does the model take to download?</h3>
<p>First visit: ~30–90 seconds depending on connection. The model is cached in IndexedDB and reused on subsequent visits.</p>

    body: `
<p>iLovePDF processes 50+ million PDFs a month, which makes it one of the most popular PDF tool suites on the web. But its free tier is heavily restricted, every file uploads to their servers, the UI is plastered with ads, and a free account is required for anything non-trivial. If any of those bother you, you're not alone — and you have great alternatives.</p>

<p>This guide ranks the 10 best iLovePDF alternatives in 2026, ordered by overall value. We weighted privacy, true free-tier limits, feature breadth, and whether the tool is open source.</p>

<h2>What's Wrong with iLovePDF?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Heavily limited free tier</strong> — large files require a Premium account ($4/month or $48/year).</li>
  <li><strong>Files upload to their servers</strong> — every operation sends your document to Spain, where it's retained "for 2 hours".</li>
  <li><strong>Ads everywhere</strong> on the free tier, including pop-ups and remarketing pixels.</li>
  <li><strong>Account required</strong> for many operations including OCR and batch processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Not open source</strong> — you have to trust their privacy claims.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. PrivaTools — Most Tools, Truly Free, Open Source</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> Yes (no quotas) · <strong>Privacy:</strong> Open source, files auto-deleted · <strong>Self-host:</strong> Yes · <strong>Tools:</strong> 152</p>
<p>PrivaTools is the comprehensive open-source alternative. It includes everything iLovePDF does (merge, split, compress, convert, OCR, sign, redact) and a lot it doesn't (video tools, audio tools, AI summarization in your browser, smart redaction with NER, JWT decoder, regex tester). The entire stack is MIT-licensed; you can audit the code or self-host it on Docker.</p>
<p>Files are processed in an isolated container and deleted immediately on response — no retention period, no upload caps beyond 500 MB per file, no watermarks, no ads, no account ever.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Privacy-conscious users, professionals handling confidential documents, organizations wanting on-premises file tooling.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> <a href="/tool/merge-pdf">Merge</a> · <a href="/tool/compress-pdf">Compress</a> · <a href="/tool/ocr-pdf">OCR</a> · <a href="/tool/edit-pdf">Edit</a> · <a href="/tool/summarize-pdf">AI Summarize</a></p>

<h2>2. Stirling-PDF — Best Self-Hosted</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> Yes (self-host) · <strong>Privacy:</strong> Self-hosted only · <strong>Tools:</strong> ~50</p>
<p>Stirling-PDF is a Java/Spring-based self-hosted PDF toolkit. Tool count is smaller (PDF-only), but it has a polished UI and a no-code workflow builder. Has no public demo — you need to spin it up via Docker yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Java/Spring shops that want enterprise PDF processing on their own infrastructure.</p>

<h2>3. PDF24 — Most Tools (95+), Free Forever, But Uploads</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> Yes · <strong>Privacy:</strong> Files uploaded to their servers · <strong>Tools:</strong> 95+</p>
<p>PDF24 is genuinely free forever with the largest pure-PDF tool set on the web. The catch: every operation uploads your file to their German servers. They claim to delete after a few hours but you have to trust that.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Users who want every conceivable PDF tool and don't care about cloud processing.</p>

<h2>4. Sejda — Best Text Editing</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> 3 tasks/hour, 50 MB cap · <strong>Privacy:</strong> Files retained 2 hours · <strong>Tools:</strong> ~35</p>
<p>Sejda's text-editor for PDFs is exceptional — it actually edits text content rather than overlaying. Free tier limits to 3 tasks/hour or 50 MB files, whichever comes first. Premium ($7.50/mo) unlocks all of it.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Occasional users who need to edit existing PDF text.</p>

<h2>5. Smallpdf — Premium UX, Premium Price</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> 2 tasks/day · <strong>Privacy:</strong> Files retained · <strong>Tools:</strong> 30+</p>
<p>Smallpdf has the slickest UI of any PDF tool. They've also added AI features (Chat with PDF, Translate PDF). Free tier is the most restrictive in this list — 2 tasks per day before you're prompted to upgrade ($9/month).</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Users willing to pay for polish.</p>

<h2>6. PDFescape — Free Browser Editor</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> Yes, 10 MB cap, 100 pages · <strong>Privacy:</strong> Uploads · <strong>Tools:</strong> ~15</p>
<p>PDFescape was one of the first browser-based PDF editors and still works fine. Limits are tight (10 MB, 100 pages) and the UI feels dated, but the free tier is generous in tasks-per-day.</p>

<h2>7. Adobe Acrobat Online</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> Very limited · <strong>Privacy:</strong> Adobe cloud · <strong>Tools:</strong> 20+</p>
<p>The industry standard. Most tools are paywalled — you'll hit a "Sign in to continue" wall fast. Quality is excellent if you have an Acrobat subscription (~$23/month).</p>

<h2>8. CloudConvert</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> 25 conversions/day · <strong>Privacy:</strong> Uploads · <strong>Tools:</strong> Format conversion</p>
<p>Specialist: file format conversion across 200+ formats including PDF. Not a full PDF editor. Generous free tier (25 conversions/day) before paid plans kick in.</p>

<h2>9. Foxit PDF Editor Online</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> Very limited · <strong>Privacy:</strong> Foxit cloud · <strong>Tools:</strong> 15+</p>
<p>Foxit makes a credible Acrobat alternative on desktop. Their online tools are basic and most useful features push to the desktop app or a paid Cloud plan.</p>

<h2>10. DocHub</h2>
<p><strong>Free:</strong> Limited · <strong>Privacy:</strong> Account required · <strong>Tools:</strong> Form filler + e-sign focus</p>
<p>DocHub specializes in form filling and electronic signatures rather than PDF manipulation. If that's your use case, it's worth a look. Otherwise, skip.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>If privacy and tool breadth matter most: <strong>PrivaTools</strong> wins. If you want pure-PDF on a cloud you don't mind: <strong>PDF24</strong>. If you only need to edit text occasionally: <strong>Sejda</strong>. Everything else is a worse trade-off in 2026.</p>

    description:
      "Drawing black boxes over text doesn't redact anything — the text is still under there. Here's how to actually remove sensitive content from a PDF so it can't be recovered.",
    publishedAt: "2026-05-15",

    tags: ["PDF", "Privacy", "Redaction", "Security"],
    body: `
<p>Public redaction failures are embarrassingly common. Lawyers, governments, and corporations have all leaked confidential information by "redacting" PDFs with black rectangles drawn on top of the text — text that is still right there, copy-pasteable to anyone with five minutes of curiosity.</p>

<p>Real redaction permanently removes the underlying content. Done correctly, the original data is unrecoverable from the redacted file. This guide explains how to do it right, what tools to use, and the common mistakes that have leaked everything from witness names to corporate financials.</p>

<h2>The #1 Redaction Mistake (and How It Leaks)</h2>
<p>The most common "redaction" mistake is drawing a black rectangle over sensitive text using a PDF annotation tool. To the eye, the text is hidden. But:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Copy/paste the page → the underlying text is still in the clipboard.</li>
  <li>Print to a new PDF → the rectangle may not flatten and the text re-appears.</li>
  <li>Open in any text-extracting tool → the redacted strings come out plaintext.</li>
</ul>
<p>This has caused multiple public disasters: court filings with witness identities leaked, government documents with classified information exposed, and corporate filings with the names of investigated executives accidentally published.</p>

<h2>How Real Redaction Works</h2>
<p>Proper redaction does two things together:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Visually obscures the area</strong> with an opaque block (typically black or white).</li>
  <li><strong>Permanently removes the underlying content</strong> — the text glyphs, the image pixels, the XMP metadata, and any other instance of the data.</li>
</ol>
<p>The technical operation is a "redaction annotation" followed by a "redaction apply" step. The PDF standard supports both. PyMuPDF, Adobe Acrobat Pro, and Foxit PhantomPDF all implement this correctly. Many "free PDF editor" web tools do not.</p>

<h2>Method 1: Manual Redaction (Best for Specific Boxes)</h2>
<p>Use this when you know exactly where the sensitive content is — a specific paragraph, a name, a signature image.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tool/redact-pdf">PrivaTools Redact PDF</a>.</li>
  <li>Upload your PDF. Each page renders as a thumbnail.</li>
  <li>Click and drag a rectangle over each area you want to permanently remove.</li>
  <li>Choose redaction color (usually black; sometimes white for "blackline" review).</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Redact</strong>. The tool applies real PyMuPDF redactions and returns a file where the content under each rectangle is unrecoverable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Verify the result: open the redacted PDF in any reader, try to copy text from a redacted area — nothing should be in the clipboard.</p>

<h2>Method 2: Smart Redact (Text-Based, Best for Bulk)</h2>
<p>Use this when sensitive content is spread throughout a document and you want every occurrence redacted automatically.</p>
<p><a href="/tool/smart-redact">Smart Redact</a> runs a BERT named-entity-recognition (NER) model in your browser to find every name, email, phone number, address, SSN, credit card, and similar entity. You review the proposed list, accept or reject each, and the backend applies real redactions to every matching location across the document.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Upload your PDF.</li>
  <li>Wait for the NER model to scan (a few seconds for typical docs).</li>
  <li>Review the suggested redactions grouped by entity type (Names · Emails · Phones · SSNs · Locations · Orgs).</li>
  <li>Uncheck false positives.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Redact all</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because NER runs in the browser (~250 MB BERT model, cached after first use), the PDF content never leaves your machine before redaction.</p>

<h2>Verifying a Redaction Worked</h2>
<p>Three checks every time:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Copy/paste test.</strong> Try to select text behind a redaction rectangle. If anything ends up in your clipboard, the redaction failed.</li>
  <li><strong>Text extraction test.</strong> Run <a href="/tool/pdf-to-text">PDF to Text</a> on the redacted file. Search for the sensitive strings. They should not appear.</li>
  <li><strong>Metadata test.</strong> Run <a href="/tool/metadata">View Metadata</a>. The XMP block may still contain hints (author name, file path, original title). Strip them with <a href="/tool/strip-metadata">Strip Metadata</a> after redacting.</li>
</ol>
<p>If all three pass, the redaction is real.</p>

<h2>Common Redaction Pitfalls</h2>
<h3>1. Redacting only the visible text, not the OCR layer</h3>
<p>Scanned PDFs often have an invisible OCR text layer underneath the rendered image. Redacting the visible pixels doesn't touch the OCR layer. Solution: redact in a tool that applies both visually and to the text layer (PyMuPDF does this; many web tools don't).</p>

<h3>2. Forgetting embedded thumbnails</h3>
<p>Some PDF readers embed a thumbnail image of each page. Drawing a black box over the rendered page doesn't update the thumbnail. Solution: re-save with <code>--garbage=4</code> (qpdf) or use a redaction tool that rebuilds embedded resources.</p>

<h3>3. Filenames and metadata</h3>
<p>If the file is named "Witness_John_Smith_Statement.pdf", redacting "John Smith" inside the document doesn't help. Rename the file and strip the XMP metadata.</p>

<h3>4. Linked content</h3>
<p>Hyperlinks pointing to <code>mailto:</code> addresses, embedded attachments, and external file references can leak data even when the visible text is redacted. Run <a href="/tool/sanitize-pdf">Sanitize PDF</a> to flatten links and embedded files.</p>

<h3>5. Image-based content that LOOKS like text</h3>
<p>If text is part of an image (a screenshot, a stamped signature), drawing over it works — the image pixels are replaced. But the original image may still be embedded if you didn't apply redaction. Always use the redaction-apply step, not just an annotation.</p>

<h2>Should You Redact in the Cloud?</h2>
<p>Most "online redact PDF" tools upload your document to their servers, apply redaction, and return the result. For routine business documents that's fine. For documents that are themselves sensitive (court filings, medical records, regulatory submissions) — the redaction is supposed to protect — sending the un-redacted file to a third party defeats the entire purpose.</p>
<p>That's why <a href="/tool/redact-pdf">PrivaTools Redact</a> processes your file inside an isolated container that auto-deletes after response, and <a href="/tool/smart-redact">Smart Redact</a> runs NER entirely in your browser. The unredacted content never persists.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Is a redaction reversible?</h3>
<p>If done correctly with a real redaction tool, no — the underlying content is removed from the PDF file. If done by drawing a rectangle annotation on top, yes — anyone with five minutes and a copy-paste shortcut can recover it.</p>

<h3>What's the difference between "redact" and "blackout"?</h3>
<p>"Blackout" usually refers to the visual style. "Redaction" is the technical operation of permanently removing content. Many tools use the words interchangeably — check what they actually do.</p>

<h3>Does PrivaTools Smart Redact see my document?</h3>
<p>Only briefly, for the final apply step. The detection (NER) runs entirely in your browser. The backend never stores your PDF.</p>

<h3>Can I redact images, not just text?</h3>
<p>Yes — image content under the redaction rectangle is replaced with the solid color, and the original image data is removed from the file structure.</p>

    title: "Why Most Online PDF Tools Are Tracking You (And What to Do About It)",
    description:
      "A look at what actually happens when you upload a PDF to a 'free' online tool — the trackers, the retention windows, the third-party pixels — and how to stay private.",
    publishedAt: "2026-05-15",
    readTime: "10 min read",
    author: "PrivaTools Team",
    tags: ["Privacy", "PDF", "Security", "Tracking"],
    body: `
<p>The PDF tool market is worth several billion dollars. None of the leading "free" services make their money from selling subscriptions — they make it from advertising, data licensing, and conversion funnels. Your file becomes the product.</p>

<p>This isn't tinfoil-hat paranoia. It's the straightforward business model documented in their own privacy policies. This article walks through what happens when you drag a PDF onto a typical free online tool, what gets logged, what gets shared, and what you can do about it.</p>

<h2>What Happens When You Upload a PDF</h2>
<p>The journey of a typical upload to a major "free" PDF tool goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You drag a file onto the upload area.</li>
  <li>The browser sends the file to the tool's server (often via S3 multipart upload).</li>
  <li>The server logs: your IP address, browser fingerprint, file size, file hash, filename, and inferred device type.</li>
  <li>The file is queued for processing on a worker. If the tool is a thin wrapper around an open-source library, the open-source binary processes the file and returns the result.</li>
  <li>The processed file is written to a download bucket. You get a temporary URL.</li>
  <li>The "delete after 2 hours" policy is enforced — usually. Sometimes it's lifecycle policies on the bucket, sometimes it's a scheduled job, sometimes it's "best effort". The original file is what's deleted, not necessarily the logs, the hashes, the file metadata, or the analytics events.</li>
  <li>Trackers fire: Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, LinkedIn Insight, sometimes specialist ad networks. They get your IP, screen size, referrer, and any user IDs the site has assigned.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's the BEST case. The WORST case is files that get retained indefinitely, used for ML training, or sold in aggregate to data brokers.</p>

<h2>What's In Their Privacy Policies (You Should Read Them)</h2>
<p>Some real language pulled from major PDF tool privacy policies (paraphrased for length):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>"We retain content for as long as necessary to provide our services."</strong> Translation: indefinitely, at our discretion.</li>
  <li><strong>"We may use your content to improve our services."</strong> Translation: training data.</li>
  <li><strong>"We share data with third-party providers."</strong> Translation: AWS, GCP, Cloudflare, plus ad networks.</li>
  <li><strong>"We may retain logs and metadata."</strong> Translation: even after we 'delete' your file, we still know you used the tool, what kind of document it was, and how often.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this is illegal. Most of it is in the privacy policy you clicked "Accept" on without reading. But it adds up to a meaningful loss of privacy that most users never notice.</p>

<h2>The Cookies and Pixels</h2>
<p>Visit a major PDF tool homepage. Open browser DevTools → Network. Filter by "Doc" to see the trackers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>google-analytics.com/collect</code> — page-view + event analytics.</li>
  <li><code>googletagmanager.com</code> — orchestrates other tags.</li>
  <li><code>doubleclick.net</code> — Google's ad network.</li>
  <li><code>facebook.com/tr/</code> — Facebook conversion pixel.</li>
  <li><code>linkedin.com/li.lms-analytics</code> — LinkedIn Insight tag.</li>
  <li><code>hotjar.com</code> or <code>fullstory.com</code> — session replay (yes, they record what you click).</li>
  <li><code>intercom.io</code> — chat widget that captures your interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the time you've uploaded a file, 5-10 third parties have your IP, browser fingerprint, and a signal that you were doing something with PDFs.</p>

<h2>The "Open Source" Test</h2>
<p>A simple test for whether a tool actually does what it claims: <strong>is the source code public?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If yes, you can audit what happens to your file.</li>
  <li>If no, you have to take their word for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The major PDF tool vendors (iLovePDF, Smallpdf, PDF24, Sejda, Adobe Acrobat Online) are all closed source. The open-source alternatives include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>PrivaTools</strong> — MIT-licensed full-stack, both online and self-hosted.</li>
  <li><strong>Stirling-PDF</strong> — Java/Spring; self-host only.</li>
  <li><strong>Mozilla pdf.js</strong> — viewer only.</li>
  <li><strong>qpdf / pdftk</strong> — command line.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Privacy-Respecting Tools Look Like</h2>
<p>A genuinely privacy-respecting PDF tool has these properties:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Open source.</strong> You can read the code.</li>
  <li><strong>No account required.</strong> No identity to log against.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimal logging.</strong> Aggregate metrics, not request-level identifiable logs.</li>
  <li><strong>Aggressive deletion.</strong> Files removed immediately after response, not "after 2 hours".</li>
  <li><strong>Browser-side processing where possible.</strong> Tools that don't need a server should run in WebAssembly.</li>
  <li><strong>No third-party trackers.</strong> Or, if any, anonymized analytics with explicit disclosure.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-host option.</strong> So you can run the tools on your own infrastructure if you don't want to trust ANY hosted service.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How PrivaTools Handles It</h2>
<p>For full transparency, here's exactly what happens when you use <a href="/">PrivaTools</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Files are processed inside an isolated Docker container.</strong> The container has no network egress; it can't phone home.</li>
  <li><strong>Files are deleted immediately after the HTTP response.</strong> No "2 hours" retention. The cleanup is a background task that fires within seconds.</li>
  <li><strong>No account, ever.</strong> The site has no login mechanism.</li>
  <li><strong>Only anonymous Google Analytics 4 page-view telemetry.</strong> No identifiable events; IP anonymization is on; blockable by any standard extension. We're considering removing GA4 entirely.</li>
  <li><strong>No third-party ad pixels, no remarketing, no session replay.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Source code is MIT-licensed</strong> at <a href="https://github.com/taiyeba-dg/privatools">github.com/taiyeba-dg/privatools</a>. Audit it yourself.</li>
  <li><strong>Browser-side tools run entirely in your browser.</strong> Files never reach our servers for tools like <a href="/tool/summarize-pdf">Summarize</a>, <a href="/tool/smart-redact">Smart Redact</a>, <a href="/tools/jwt-decoder">JWT Decoder</a>, <a href="/tools/regex-tester">Regex Tester</a>, <a href="/tools/password-generator">Password Generator</a>, and more.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-hostable.</strong> <code>docker compose up --build</code> and you're running your own instance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You Can Do Right Now</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Use browser-side tools when possible.</strong> Look for "client-side" or "browser-only" badges.</li>
  <li><strong>Install uBlock Origin.</strong> Blocks the ad pixels and analytics from firing.</li>
  <li><strong>Read privacy policies.</strong> Search them for "retain", "share", "improve our services". The honest ones are short and specific.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-host the tools you use most.</strong> Open-source projects make this trivial.</li>
  <li><strong>Don't upload anything you wouldn't want stored.</strong> If it's truly sensitive (medical, legal, financial), use a desktop tool or a self-hosted instance.</li>
</ol>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Are the trackers actually a problem if I'm not doing anything secret?</h3>
<p>The trackers themselves aren't dangerous. The aggregation problem is. Every site sees a slice; advertisers and data brokers stitch them together. You don't get to see your composite profile or correct it.</p>

<h3>Is "we delete after 2 hours" enough?</h3>
<p>It's better than retaining indefinitely. It's worse than not uploading in the first place. Two hours is plenty of time for a misconfigured backup, a debugging engineer, or an internal log query to copy the file somewhere it won't be deleted.</p>

<h3>What's the safest way to use online PDF tools?</h3>
<p>In order of safety: (1) use a desktop tool, (2) self-host an open-source one, (3) use a browser-side tool that doesn't upload, (4) use an open-source online tool with aggressive deletion, (5) use any free closed-source tool with no caveats about retention.</p>

    description:
      "Apple's HEIC format is space-efficient but incompatible with most software. Here's how to convert HEIC to PDF, JPG, or PNG online, on Mac, on Windows, and in batch.",
    publishedAt: "2026-05-15",
    readTime: "7 min read",
    author: "PrivaTools Team",
    tags: ["HEIC", "Image", "Conversion", "How-To"],
    body: `
<p>If you've ever tried to email a photo from your iPhone to someone on Windows, you've met HEIC — Apple's High Efficiency Image Container format. It cuts file sizes in half compared to JPEG, but most non-Apple software can't open it. Photos arrive as broken thumbnails or won't import at all.</p>

<p>This guide covers every way to convert HEIC: online tools, native Mac, native Windows, batch conversion, and what you lose along the way.</p>

<h2>What Is HEIC, Anyway?</h2>
<p>HEIC is Apple's wrapper around the HEIF image format, which itself wraps HEVC-encoded image data. Compared to JPEG, HEIC files are typically:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>40–60% smaller</strong> at equivalent visual quality.</li>
  <li><strong>10-bit color</strong> (vs. JPEG's 8-bit) — better for HDR and pro photography.</li>
  <li><strong>Capable of storing depth maps</strong> for Portrait Mode and effects.</li>
  <li><strong>Supports image sequences</strong> (Live Photos), animations, and alpha channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>The catch: HEIF/HEIC depends on HEVC, which is patent-encumbered. That's the main reason Windows, Android, Linux, and many web tools have been slow to support it.</p>

<h2>Method 1: Convert HEIC Online (Browser)</h2>
<p>The fastest, most universal approach. No software install.</p>

<h3>HEIC → PDF</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tool/heic-to-pdf">HEIC to PDF</a>.</li>
  <li>Drag one or many HEIC files into the upload area.</li>
  <li>Choose page size (Letter or A4) and orientation.</li>
  <li>Click Convert. You get a single PDF with one HEIC per page.</li>
</ol>

<h3>HEIC → JPG</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tool/heic-to-jpg">HEIC to JPG</a>.</li>
  <li>Drag your HEIC.</li>
  <li>Choose JPEG quality (default 85 is fine for most use).</li>
  <li>Click Convert and download.</li>
</ol>

<h3>HEIC → PNG</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tools/heic-to-png">HEIC to PNG</a>.</li>
  <li>Drag your HEIC.</li>
  <li>Click Convert.</li>
</ol>
<p>PNG is lossless but produces files 3–5x larger than JPG. Use PNG if you need transparency or are doing further editing.</p>

<h2>Method 2: Mac (Built-In, Free)</h2>
<p>macOS handles HEIC natively. To convert:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the HEIC in Preview.</li>
  <li>File → Export.</li>
  <li>Choose JPEG, PNG, or PDF as the format.</li>
  <li>Click Save.</li>
</ol>
<p>For batch: select multiple HEICs in Finder → right-click → <em>Quick Actions</em> → <em>Convert Image</em> → choose format. macOS Sonoma (14) and later have this built in.</p>

<h2>Method 3: Windows (HEIF Extensions or Online)</h2>
<p>Windows 11 supports HEIC if you install the Microsoft "HEIF Image Extensions" from the Store (free, despite the upsell to a $0.99 paid version). After installing:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the HEIC in the Photos app.</li>
  <li>Click "..." → Save as → choose JPEG or PNG.</li>
</ol>
<p>For batch, the easiest path on Windows is still the online tool above.</p>

<h2>Method 4: iPhone Settings (Stop Generating HEIC in the First Place)</h2>
<p>If you'd rather your iPhone produce JPEG directly:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Settings → Camera → Formats.</li>
  <li>Choose "Most Compatible" (instead of "High Efficiency").</li>
</ol>
<p>Future photos will be JPEG. Existing HEICs need to be converted.</p>

<h2>Method 5: Command Line (Batch + Scripts)</h2>
<p>For large batches or automation, command line is fastest:</p>
<pre><code>brew install libheif imagemagick   # macOS, one time
for f in *.heic; do
  heif-convert "$f" "\${f%.heic}.jpg"
done</code></pre>
<p>Or with ImageMagick:</p>
<pre><code>magick mogrify -format jpg *.heic</code></pre>

<h2>Privacy Note</h2>
<p>HEIC files contain extensive EXIF metadata: GPS location, camera model, capture time, even depth maps. Before sharing converted files publicly, strip the metadata:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="/tool/remove-exif">Remove EXIF</a> after converting.</li>
  <li>Or view what's in there first with <a href="/tools/view-exif">View EXIF Data</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For sensitive photos, the online converters worth using are the ones that auto-delete files after conversion (e.g., PrivaTools) rather than retaining them on their servers.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Does converting HEIC to JPG lose quality?</h3>
<p>Slightly, since HEIC supports 10-bit color and JPEG only supports 8-bit. For most viewing and printing the loss is imperceptible. For pro photography work, convert HEIC to PNG or TIFF instead.</p>

<h3>What's the difference between HEIC and HEIF?</h3>
<p>HEIF is the container format (defined by MPEG); HEIC is Apple's specific implementation/extension. In practice the terms are interchangeable.</p>

<h3>Why doesn't my email client show HEIC previews?</h3>
<p>Most email clients (Gmail web, Outlook desktop) can't decode HEIC. Recipients see a generic attachment icon. Always convert to JPG before emailing.</p>

<h3>Is HEIC the future of digital photography?</h3>
<p>Probably not. AVIF (a newer royalty-free format) is gaining traction and is supported in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Expect AVIF to gradually replace HEIC over the next few years.</p>

    description:
      "JWT tokens are everywhere in modern web auth. Here's how they're structured, how to decode them, what each claim means, and why you should never paste a real JWT into a random online decoder.",
    publishedAt: "2026-05-15",
    readTime: "8 min read",
    author: "PrivaTools Team",
    tags: ["JWT", "Developer", "Security", "How-To"],
    body: `
<p>If you've worked with modern web auth, you've seen tokens that look like this:</p>
<pre><code>eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwiZXhwIjoxNzMwMDAwMDAwfQ.signature</code></pre>
<p>That's a JWT — JSON Web Token. It's the standard format for stateless authentication across REST APIs, OAuth flows, and microservice mesh systems. JWTs are not encrypted; they're just signed. Decoding them is trivial. Verifying their signature requires the issuer's secret or public key.</p>

<p>This guide explains the JWT structure, how to decode one, what each standard claim means, and how to decode JWTs without leaking them to a random online service.</p>

<h2>The Three Parts of a JWT</h2>
<p>Every JWT has three dot-separated parts:</p>
<pre><code>HEADER.PAYLOAD.SIGNATURE</code></pre>
<p>Each part is <strong>base64url-encoded</strong>. Base64url is regular base64 with two character swaps (<code>+</code> → <code>-</code>, <code>/</code> → <code>_</code>) and no padding. Some implementations are picky about the padding; most aren't.</p>

<h3>1. Header</h3>
<p>The header tells you the signing algorithm and the token type:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}</code></pre>
<p>Common <code>alg</code> values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HS256, HS384, HS512</strong> — HMAC with SHA-2. Symmetric: same secret signs and verifies.</li>
  <li><strong>RS256, RS384, RS512</strong> — RSA. Asymmetric: private key signs, public key verifies.</li>
  <li><strong>ES256, ES384, ES512</strong> — ECDSA. Asymmetric, smaller signatures than RSA.</li>
  <li><strong>EdDSA</strong> — Ed25519 / Ed448. Modern asymmetric, fast.</li>
  <li><strong>none</strong> — DANGER. No signature. Most libraries refuse to accept these now.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Payload (Claims)</h3>
<p>The payload is the JSON object you actually care about. It contains "claims" — assertions about an entity. Decoding shows something like:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "sub": "user-42",
  "iat": 1730000000,
  "exp": 1730003600,
  "iss": "auth.example.com",
  "aud": "api.example.com",
  "scope": "read:profile write:profile"
}</code></pre>
<p>Standard claims (defined by RFC 7519):</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>iss</code> (issuer): who created and signed the token.</li>
  <li><code>sub</code> (subject): who the token is about. Usually a user ID.</li>
  <li><code>aud</code> (audience): which service(s) should accept the token.</li>
  <li><code>iat</code> (issued at): Unix timestamp of creation.</li>
  <li><code>exp</code> (expires at): Unix timestamp after which the token is invalid.</li>
  <li><code>nbf</code> (not before): Unix timestamp before which the token isn't valid yet.</li>
  <li><code>jti</code> (JWT ID): unique token identifier (for revocation tracking).</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else (roles, scopes, custom permissions) is application-specific.</p>

<h3>3. Signature</h3>
<p>The signature is computed over <code>base64url(header) + "." + base64url(payload)</code> using the algorithm specified in the header and the issuer's secret (HS*) or private key (RS*/ES*). It's there so a recipient can verify the token wasn't tampered with — given the right key.</p>
<p><strong>The signature does NOT make the token confidential.</strong> Anyone can decode header and payload. The signature only proves the token came from someone who has the signing key.</p>

<h2>How to Decode a JWT</h2>
<h3>Online (Browser-Side, Safe)</h3>
<p>Paste your JWT into <a href="/tools/jwt-decoder">PrivaTools JWT Decoder</a>. The token is decoded entirely in JavaScript inside your browser — never sent to any server. You'll see the header, payload (with iat/exp converted to ISO 8601), and signature.</p>

<h3>Command Line</h3>
<pre><code># With jq
echo "$TOKEN" | cut -d. -f2 | base64 -d 2>/dev/null | jq

# With Python

<h3>What NOT to Do: Public Online Decoders</h3>
<p>There are many "JWT decoder" sites that send your token to their server. Some log the token. A logged production JWT is an instant authentication bypass — anyone with the log file can impersonate the user until the token expires.</p>
<p>Always use a decoder that processes the token client-side. Verify by opening DevTools → Network and confirming no outgoing request fires when you paste a token.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
<h3>1. Trusting an unsigned token</h3>
<p>An attacker can construct any JWT they want with <code>alg: none</code> and no signature. Many JWT libraries used to accept these. Always validate the algorithm matches what your service expects.</p>

<h3>2. Confusing decoding with verification</h3>
<p>Decoding shows you what the token claims. <strong>Verification</strong> proves the claims are authentic. You need the issuer's key to verify. A decoded-but-not-verified token tells you nothing trustworthy.</p>

<h3>3. Leaking tokens in URLs</h3>
<p>JWTs in URL query strings get logged everywhere — browser history, server access logs, analytics, CDNs. Always pass them in the <code>Authorization: Bearer</code> header.</p>

<h3>4. Long-lived tokens</h3>
<p>If your <code>exp</code> is days or weeks in the future, a single token theft is a long-lived compromise. Use short-lived access tokens (5–15 minutes) plus refresh tokens for sessions.</p>

<h3>5. Storing JWTs in localStorage</h3>
<p>localStorage is accessible to any JavaScript on the page. XSS = token theft. Use HttpOnly cookies for browser-side session tokens, or in-memory storage with a sliding refresh.</p>

<h2>How to Verify a JWT (Beyond Decode)</h2>
<p>Verifying requires:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The signing algorithm from the header.</li>
  <li>The corresponding key (secret for HS*, public key for RS*/ES*).</li>
  <li>Recomputing the signature over header.payload with that key.</li>
  <li>Comparing the recomputed signature against the one in the token.</li>
</ol>
<p>Use a library — never roll your own. Common picks: <code>jsonwebtoken</code> (Node), <code>PyJWT</code> (Python), <code>jjwt</code> (Java), <code>github.com/golang-jwt/jwt</code> (Go).</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Is the JWT signature reversible?</h3>
<p>No. It's a one-way hash. You can verify it given the key but you can't extract the key from a signature alone (without a brute force attack on a weak secret).</p>

<h3>Can I decode a JWT without the secret?</h3>
<p>Yes. Header and payload are just base64-encoded JSON. The secret is only needed for verification.</p>

<h3>Are JWTs encrypted?</h3>
<p>By default, no. They're signed but not encrypted. There IS a sibling spec called JWE (JSON Web Encryption) that adds encryption, but it's much less commonly used.</p>

<h3>Is it safe to log JWT payloads in my server logs?</h3>
<p>It's safer to log the <code>sub</code> claim (user ID) and the <code>jti</code> claim (token ID) but NOT the full token. The full token would let anyone with log access impersonate the user.</p>
