          <h2>The Short Version</h2>
          <p>
            PrivaTools does not collect, store, or sell your personal data. We do not use cookies,
            analytics trackers, or advertising scripts. Your files are processed in temporary memory
            and deleted immediately after processing completes. We have no data to sell because we
            collect no data.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Files You Upload</h2>
          <p>
            When you use a server-side tool (e.g., Merge PDF, Compress PDF), your file is uploaded
            to our processing server over an encrypted HTTPS connection. Here is exactly what happens:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Your file is held in temporary server memory (RAM) only for the duration of processing. It is never written to disk or permanent storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> The moment processing completes and your result is delivered, the original file and the output are purged from memory. This typically takes less than one second after download.</li>
            <li><strong>No inspection:</strong> Our servers process raw bytes. We never read, analyze, index, or inspect the contents of your files. We have no knowledge of what you upload.</li>
            <li><strong>No retention:</strong> We do not retain copies, backups, thumbnails, or metadata from your files. Once deleted, they are unrecoverable.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Client-Side Tools</h2>
          <p>
            Several tools (JSON Formatter, Text Diff, Base64 Encoder, Hash Generator, CSV-JSON Converter,
            Markdown-HTML Converter) run entirely in your browser using JavaScript. Your data never leaves
            your device — not even temporarily. Zero network requests are made.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
          <p>We do not collect:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Names, email addresses, or account credentials (no accounts exist)</li>
            <li>IP addresses or geolocation data</li>
            <li>Browser fingerprints or device identifiers</li>
            <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
            <li>Cookies of any kind (first-party or third-party)</li>
            <li>File metadata, filenames, or content from uploaded files</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Server Infrastructure</h2>
          <p>
            PrivaTools runs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (ARM-based, 24 GB RAM). The server is
            located in a single data center and is maintained by the PrivaTools team. We use HTTPS
            with HSTS for all connections. Our server does not log request bodies or file contents.
            Standard web server access logs (timestamps, HTTP status codes, request paths) may be
            retained for up to 7 days for operational debugging, but these logs never contain file
            data or personally identifiable information.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>
            PrivaTools uses the following third-party services:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics (GA4):</strong> We use Google Analytics to understand how visitors use the site — which tools are popular, how people find us, and general usage patterns. Google Analytics collects anonymized page view data, browser type, and approximate location (country-level). It does not have access to your uploaded files. You can opt out using a <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">browser extension</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Fonts:</strong> Typography is loaded via Google Fonts. Google may collect anonymized usage data through font requests.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            No advertising networks, remarketing scripts, or user profiling tools are used.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Open Source Transparency</h2>
          <p>
            The entire PrivaTools codebase — frontend and backend — is open source under the MIT
            license at{" "}
            <a href="https://github.com/taiyeba-dg/privatools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              github.com/taiyeba-dg/privatools
            </a>
            . You can audit every line of code that handles your files. If you prefer maximum privacy,
            you can self-host the entire application using Docker.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            PrivaTools does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children
            under 13. Since we collect no personal data and require no accounts, there is no
            age-specific data to protect.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>
            If we change this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of
            this page. Since we collect no user data, we have no way to notify you directly — we
            recommend checking this page periodically if privacy is a concern.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Contact</h2>
